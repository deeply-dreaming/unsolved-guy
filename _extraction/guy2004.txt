Preface to the Third Edition


After 10 years (or should I say 4000 years?) what's new? Too much to
accommodate here, even though we've continued to grow exponentially.
Sections A20, C21, D29 and F32 have been added, and existing sections
expanded. The bibliographies are no doubt one of the more useful aspects
of the book, but have become so extensive in some places that occasional
reluctant pruning has taken place, leaving the reader to access secondary,
but at least more accessible, sources.
     A useful new feature is the lists, at the ends of about half of the sec-
tions, of references to OEIS, Neil Sloane's Online Encyclopedia of Integer
Sequences. Many thanks to Neil for his suggestion, and for his help with
its implementation. As this is a first appearance, many sequences will be
missing that ought to be mentioned, and a few that are may be inappropri-
ately placed. As more people make use of this important resource, I hope
that they will let me have a steady stream of further suggestions.
    I get a great deal of pleasure from the interest that so many people
have shown, and consequently the help that they provide. This happens
so often that it is impossible to acknowledge all of it here. Many names
are mentioned in earlier prefaces. I especially miss Dick Lehmer, Raphael
Robinson and Paul Erdos [the various monetary rewards he offered may
still be negotiable via Ron Graham].
     Renewed thanks to those mentioned earlier and new or renewed thanks
to Stefan Bartels, Mike Bennett, David Boyd, Andrew Bremner, Kevin
Brown, Kevin Buzzard, Chris Caldwell, Phil Carmody, Henri Cohen, Karl

Preface to the Second Edition


Erdos recalls that Landau, at the International Congress in Cambridge in
1912, gave a talk about primes and mentioned four problems (see AI, A5,
CI below) which were unattackable in the present state of science, and says
that they still are. On the other hand, since the first edition of this book,
some remarkable progress has been made. Fermat's last theorem (modulo
some holes that are expected to be filled in), the Mordell conjecture, the
infinitude of Carmichael numbers, and a host of other problems have been
settled.
     The book is perpetually out of date; not always the 1700 years of one
statement in DI in the first edition, but at least a few months between
yesterday's entries and your reading of the first copies off the press. To
ease comparison with the first edition, the numbering of the sections is
still the same. Problems which have been largely or completely answered
are B47, D2, D6, D8, D16, D26, D27, D28, E15, F15, Fl7 & F28.
Related open questions have been appended in some cases, but in others
they have become exercises, rather than problems.
     Two of the author's many idiosyncrasies are mentioned here: the use of
the ampersand (&) to denote joint work and remove any possible ambiguity
from phrases such as ' ... follows from the work of GauE and Erdos & Guy';
and the use of the notation
                               i ............ ?
borrowed from the Hungarians, for a conjectural or hypothetical statement.
This could have alleviated some anguish had it been used by the well in-
tentioned but not very well advised author of an introductory calculus
text. A student was having difficulty in finding the derivative of a product.
Frustrated myself, I asked to see the student's text. He had highlighted a
displayed formula stating that the derivative of a product was the product
of the derivatives, without noting that the context was 'Why is ... not the
right answer?'
     The threatened volume on Unsolved Problems in Geometry has ap-
peared, and is already due for reprinting or for a second edition.
     It will be clear from the text how many have accepted my invitation
to use this as a clearing house and how indebted I am to correspondents.

                                                                          vii

at least offer my thanks to Harvey Abbott, Arthur Baragar, Paul Bate-

the encyclopedic knowledge of the literature, and the clarity and ingenuity
of the mathematics of John Leech.
    Thanks also to Andy Guy for setting up the electronic framework which
has made both the author's and the publisher's task that much easier. The
Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada continue to
support this and many other of the author's projects.

Preface to the First Edition
    To many laymen, mathematicians appear to be problem solvers, people
who do "hard sums". Even inside the profession we classify ourselves as
either theorists or problem solvers. Mathematics is kept alive, much more
than by the activities of either class, by the appearance of a succession
of unsolved problems, both from within mathematics itself and from the
increasing number of disciplines where it is applied. Mathematics often
owes more to those who ask questions than to those who answer them.
The solution of a problem may stifle interest in the area around it. But
"Fermat's Last Theorem", because it is not yet a theorem, has generated a
great deal of "good" mathematics, whether goodness is judged by beauty,
by depth or by applicability.
    To pose good unsolved problems is a difficult art. The balance between
triviality and hopeless unsolvability is delicate. There are many simply
stated problems which experts tell us are unlikely to be solved in the next
generation. But we have seen the Four Color Conjecture settled, even if we
don't live long enough to learn the status of the Riemann and Goldbach
hypotheses, of twin primes or Mersenne primes, or of odd perfect numbers.
On the other hand, "unsolved" problems may not be unsolved at all, or
may be much more tractable than was at first thought.
    Among the many contributions made by Hungarian mathematician
Erdos Pal, not least is the steady flow of well-posed problems. As if these
were not incentive enough, he offers rewards for the first solution of many
of them, at the same time giving his estimate of their difficulty. He has
made many payments, from $1.00 to $1000.00.
    One purpose of this book is to provide beginning researchers, and others
who are more mature, but isolated from adequate mathematical stimulus,
with a supply of easily understood, if not easily solved, problems which they
can consider in varying depth, and by making occasional partial progress,
gradually acquire the interest, confidence and persistence that are essential
to successful research.
    But the book has a much wider purpose. It is important for students
and teachers of mathematics at all levels to realize that although they are
not yet capable of research and may have no hopes or ambitions in that
direction, there are plenty of unsolved problems that are well within their
comprehension, some of which will be solved in their lifetime. Many ama-
teurs have been attracted to the subject and many successful researchers
first gained their confidence by examining problems in euclidean geometry,

                                                                           ix

in number theory, and more recently in combinatorics and graph theory,
where it is possible to understand questions and even to formulate them
and obtain original results without a deep prior theoretical knowledge.
    The idea for the book goes back some twenty years, when I was im-
pressed by the circulation of lists of problems by the late Leo Moser and
co-author Hallard Croft, and by the articles of Erdos. Croft agreed to let
me help him amplify his collection into a book, and Erdos has repeatedly
encouraged and prodded us. After some time, the Number Theory chapter
swelled into a volume of its own, part of a series which will contain a vol-
ume on Geometry, Convexity and Analysis, written by Hallard T. Croft,
and one on Combinatorics, Graphs and Games by the present writer.
    References, sometimes extensive bibliographies, are collected at the end
of each problem or article surveying a group of problems, to save the reader
from turning pages. In order not to lose the advantage of having all refer-
ences collected in one alphabetical list, we give an Index of Authors, from
which particular papers can easily be located provided the author is not
too prolific. Entries in this index and in the General Index and Glossary
of Symbols are to problem numbers instead of page numbers.
    Many people have looked at parts of drafts, corresponded and made
helpful comments. Some of these were personal friends who are no longer
with us: Harold Davenport, Hans Heilbronn, Louis Mordell, Leo Moser,
Theodor Motzkin, Alfred Renyi and Paul Turan. Others are H. L. Abbott,
J. W. S. Cassels, J. H. Conway, P. Erdos, Martin Gardner, R. L. Gra-
ham, H. Halberstam, D. H. and Emma Lehmer, A. M. Odlyzko, Carl
Pomerance, A. Schinzel, J. L. Selfridge, N. J. A. Sloane, E. G. Straus,
H. P. F. Swinnerton-Dyer and Hugh Williams. A grant from the National
Research Council of Canada has facilited contact with these and many oth-
ers. The award of a Killam Resident Fellowship at the University of Cal-
gary was especially helpful during the writing of a final draft. The technical
typing was done by Karen McDermid, by Betty Teare and by Louise Guy,
who also helped with the proof-reading. The staff of Springer-Verlag in
New York has been courteous, competent and helpful.
    In spite of all this help, many errors remain, for which I assume reluctant
responsibility. In any case, if the book is to serve its purpose it will start
becoming out of date from the moment it appears; it has been becoming out
of date ever since its writing began. I would be glad to hear from readers.
There must be many solutions and references and problems which I don't
know about. I hope that people will avail themselves of this clearing house.
A few good researchers thrive by rediscovering results for themselves, but
many of us are disappointed when we find that our discoveries have been
anticipated.

Introduction


Number theory has fascinated both the amateur and the professional for
a longer time than any other branch of mathematics, so that much of it is
now of considerable technical difficulty. However, there are more unsolved
problems than ever before, and though many of these are unlikely to be
solved in the next generation, this probably won't deter people from trying.
They are so numerous that they have already filled more than one volume:
the present book is just a personal sample.
    Some good sources of problems in number theory were listed in the
Introduction to the first edition, some of which are repeated here, along
with more recent references.

   Throughout this volume, "number" means natural number, i.e.,
                                0,1,2, ...
and c is an absolute positive constant, not necessarily taking the same
value at each appearance. We use K. E. Iverson's symbols (popularized by
Donald Knuth) "floor"(l J) and "ceiling" (f l)for "the greatest integer not
greater than" and "the least integer not less than.' A less familiar symbol
may be "m..l n" for "m is prime to n" or "gcd(m, n) = I."
   The book is partitioned, somewhat arbitrarily at times, into six sections:

                        B. Divisibility
                        C. Additive number theory
                        D. Diophantine equations
                        E. Sequences of integers

A. Prime Numbers


We can partition the positive integers into three classes:

the unit 1

the primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, ...

the composite numbers 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, ...

A number greater than 1 is prime if its only positive divisors are 1 and
itself; otherwise it's composite. Primes have interested mathematicians at
least since Euclid, who showed that there are infinitely many. The largest
prime in the Bible is 22273 at Numbers, 3 xliii.
    The greatest common divisor (gcd) of m and n is denoted by (m, n),
e.g., (36,66) = 6, (14,15) = 1, (1001,1078) = 77. If (m, n) = 1, we say
that m and n are coprime and write m ..1 n; for example 182 ..1 165.
    Denote the n-th prime by Pn, e.g. PI = 2, P2 = 3, P99 = 523; and the
number of primes not greater than x by 7r(x), e.g., 7r(2) = 1, 7r(3~) = 2,
7r(1000) = 168, 7r(4· 10 16 ) = 1075292778753150.
    The table on the next page is an extension of that on p. 146 of Conway
& Guy, The Book of Numbers, and compares 7r(x) with Legendre's Law,

contains a repeated factor and (_I)W if x contains w distinct prime factors

   Dirichlet's theorem tells us that there are infinitely many primes in any
arithmetic progression,

                         a,   a + b,     a + 2b,   a + 3b,
provided a ..1 b.
   A paper of Dickson, not easily accessed, has a misleading title which
suggests that he generalizes Dirichlet's theorem to more than one arithmetic
progression. His History merely says 'Dickson asked' - a question often
asked, before and since, and which would answer numerous other queries
such as:
           i are there infinitely many prime pairs (p, 2p - 1) ?
                     i or infinitely many (p, 2p + 1) ?
(compare A7); and has misled some to believe that Schinzel's conjecture
           i Tout nombre rationnel positif peut etre represente d'une in-
           finite maniere sous la forme (p + 1) / (q + 1) ainsi que sous la
           forme (p - 1) / (q - 1) ou p et q sont des nombres premiers ?
has been settled, whereas it has not. Matthew Conroy has verified that
the first 109 integers can be so expressed. For a partial result, see Peter
Elliott's paper.
    A more sweeping conjecture of Schinzel is his Hypothesis H: if II (x),
h(x), ... , fk(X) are integer-valued polynomials with product f(x), and for
every prime p there is an a such that f(a) is not divisible by p, then there
are infinitely many n such that II (n), h(n), ... , f(n) are all simultaneously
prime.

    This embodies six of the famous Hardy-Littlewood conjectures (see ref-
erence at AI) and has been quantized as the Bateman-Horn conjecture:
if the polynomials are irreducible, with integer coeeficients, and the prod-
uct of their degrees is h, then the number, QU; N) of n :::; N for which the
k polynomials simultaneously take prime values is asymptotically

ence f(x) == mod p (see reference at AI7).
    Table 7 (D 27) can be used as a table of primes < 1000, an entry 1, 3,
5 or 7 indicates a prime in that residue class (see A4) modulo 8.
    The general problem of determining whether a large number is prime or
composite, and in the latter case of determining its factors, has fascinated
number theorists down the ages. With the advent of high speed computers,
considerable advances have been made, and a special stimulus has recently
been provided by the application to cryptanalysis. A recent breakthrough
by Agrawal, Kayal & Saxena shows that prime testing can be done in
polynomial time, though it may be a while before this becomes of practical
value.

Al Prime values of quadratic functions.
Are there infinitely many primes of the form a 2 + 1 ? Probably so, and in
fact Hardy and Littlewood (their conjecture E) guessed that the number,
P( n), of such primes less than n, was asymptotic to cJnI In n,

                              P(n) '" cvn/lnn         ?

i.e., that the ratio of P(n) to /iiI In n tends to c as n tends to infinity. The
constant c is




where   (-;1) is the Legendre symbol (see F5) and the product is taken
over all odd primes. They make similar conjectures, differing only in the
8                                      Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

value of c, for the number of primes represented by more general quadratic
expressions. But we don't know of any integer polynomial, of degree greater
than one, for which it has been proved that it takes an infinity of prime
values. Is there even one prime a 2 + b for each b > O? Sierpinski has shown
that for every k there is a b such that there are more than k primes of the
form a 2 + b.

   Fouvry & Iwaniek have shown that there are infinitely many primes
p = l2+m 2 where l is also prime. This provided motivation for Friedlander
& Iwaniec to prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form a 2 +b4 •
Moreover, the frequency of primes follows the expected distribution.

    Iwaniec has shown that there are infinitely many n for which n 2 +1 is the
product of at most two primes, and his results extend to other irreducible
quadratics. With Friedlander he has come close by showing that there are
infinitly many primes of shape n 2 + m4.

   If P( n) is the largest prime factor of n, Maurice Mignotte has shown
that P(a 2 + 1) 2: 17 if a 2: 240. Note that 239 2 + 1 = 2.134 (yet another
property of 239). It has been known for 50 years that P(a 2 + 1) -> 00 with
a.

   Ulam and others noticed that the pattern formed by the prime numbers
when the sequence of numbers is written in a "square spiral" seems to favor
diagonals which correspond to certain "prime-rich" quadratic polynomials.
For example the main diagonal of Figure 1 corresponds to Euler's famous
formula n 2 + n + 41.

   Subject to Hardy & Littlewood's Conjecture F, Jacobson expects that
the quadratic x 2 + x + 3399714628553118047 will have, asymptotically, a

    Discoveries since the second edition by Harvey Dubner and others have
brought the lists to:
    n! + 1 is prime for n = 1, 2, 3, 11, 27, 37, 41, 73, 77, 116, 154, 320, 340,
399, 427, 872, 1477, 6380.
    n! - 1 is prime for n = 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 30, 32, 33, 38, 94, 166, 324,
379,469, 546, 974, 1963, 3507, 3610, 6917, 21480.

392113.
    P# - 1 is prime for P = 3, 5, 11, 13, 41, 89, 317, 337, 991, 1873, 2053,
2377, 4093, 4297, 4583, 6569, 13033, 15877.
    Let q be the least prime greater than pi. Then Reo F. Fortune con-
jectured that q - P# is prime (or 1) for all primes p. It is clear that it can
only be divisible by primes greater than p, and Selfridge observes that the
truth of the conjecture would follow from Schinzel's formulation of Cramer's
conjecture, that for x > 7.1374035 there is always a prime between x and
x + (In x)2. Stan Wagon has calculated the first 100 fortunate primes:

under the assumption that the very large probable primes involved are gen-
uine primes. The answers to the questions are probably "yes", but it does
not seem conceivable that such conjectures will come within reach either
of computers or of analytical tools in the foreseeable future. Schinzels con-
jecture@Schinzel's conjecture has been attributed to Cramer, but Cramer
conjectured (see reference at AS)

                             .
                            1lmsup Pn+l - Pn
                                    (1    )2 = 1          ?
                             n--+oo     npn

Schinzel notes that this doesn't imply the existence of a prime between x
and x + (In x) 2 , even for sufficiently large x.
    More hopeful, but still difficult, is the following conjecture of Erdos and
Stewart: are 1!+ 1 = 2, 2!+ 1 = 3, 3!+ 1 = 7, 4!+ 1 = 52, 5!+ 1 = 112 the only
cases where n! + 1 = P~P~+1 and Pk-l :::; n < Pk? [Note that (a, b) = (1,0),
(1,0), (0,1), (2,0) and (0,2) in these five cases.] Flammenkamp & Luca
announced on 98-12-16 that they had proved the conjecture.
    Erdos also asks if there are infinitely many primes P for which P - k!
is composite for each k such that 1 :::; k! < Pi for example, P = 101 and
P = 211. He suggests that it may be easier to show that there are infinitely
many integers n (i! < n :::; (i + I)!) all of whose prime factors are greater
than i, and for which all the numbers n - k! (1:::; k :::; i) are composite.
12                                    Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

    One of the few necessary and sufficient theorems about prime numbers
is Wilson's theorem: A necessary and sufficient condition that m > 1
should be prime is that m divides (m - I)! + 1. A curiosity is that p2
divides (p - I)! + 1 for p = 5, 13 and 563. Crandall, Dilcher & Pomerance
(reference at A3) show that there are no other such Wilson primes below
5 . lOB.
    Javier Soria asked for what p is (1 + (p - 1)!)/p also prime? E.g., 5,
7, 11, 29, 773, .... Mike Oakes found just two more such numbers, 1321
and 2621, up to 30941, which yield probable primes. Are there infinitely
many? Several, including Noam Elkies, Dean Hickerson, Carl Pmerance
and Bjorn Poonen gave a heuristic argument suggesting that there are.
    Subbarao followed Erdos and defined a Pillai prime as a prime p for
which there is an n such that n! + 1 == 0 (mod p), but p ¢ 1 (mod n). The
Pillai primes < 100 are 23, 29, 59, 61, 67, 71, 79 and 83. G. E. Hardy &
Subbarao prove that there are infinitely many Pillai primes, and infinitely
many associated values of n, which they modestly call EHS numbers;
the first few are 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22. Do the Pillai primes
have an asymptotic density? Experimental results suggest that they do,
and that it may be between 0.5 and 0.6. On the other hand there seems no
reason why it should not be 1. Is the density of EHS numbers ~ ? If g(p)
is the number of n < p for which n! + 1 == 0 (mod p), is lim sup g(p) = oo?
Perhaps g(p) ~ 00 for almost all primes p. The density, call it ek, of primes
p for which g(p) = k probably exists for each k and E~=l = 1.
    Erdos asked if there were many p for which n! (mod p) has p-2 nonzero
values. Perhaps p = 5 is the only one. Theorem 114 of Hardy & Wright
implies that such pare == 1 (mod 4). Erdos also asked, if A(x) is the
number of composite u < x for which n! + 1 == 0 (mod u), is A(x) = o(x€)?
Examples of such u are 25, 121, 721.
    Hardy & Subbarao believe that, if f(P) is the least integer for which
f(P)! + 1 == 0 (mod p), then there are infinitely many p for which f(P) =
p - 1, but that the number of such p ~ x is o( x/In x). Erdos believed that
f(P)/p ~ 0 for almost all p.

A3 Mersenne primes. Repunits. Fermat
numbers. Primes of shape k . 2n + 1.
Primes of special form have been of perennial interest, especially the Mer-
senne primes 2P - 1. Here p is necessarily prime, but that is not a
sufficient condition! 211 - 1 = 2047 = 23·89. They are connected with
perfect numbers (see B 1).
    The powerful Lucas Lehmer test@Lucas-Lehmer test, in conjunction
with successive generations of computers, and more sophisticated tech-
niques in using them, continues to add to the list of primes p for which
2P - 1 is also prime:

14                                     Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

    The number of Mersenne primes is undoubtedly infinite, but proof is
again hopelessly beyond reach. Suppose M (x) is the number of primes p :-:;
x for which 2P -1 is prime. Find a convincing heuristic argument for the size
of M(x). Gillies gave one suggesting that M(x) rv clnx. H. W. Lenstra,
Pomerance and Wagstaff all believe this and in fact suggest that
                          i     M(x) rv e'Ylogx       ?
where the log is to base 2.
     The largest known prime is usually a Mersenne prime, but in early
1992 the record was 391581· 2216193 -1, discovered by J. Brown, L.C. Noll,
B. Parady, G. Smith, J. Smith & S. Zarantonello.
     D. H. Lehmer puts 8 1 = 4, 8k+1 = 8~ - 2, supposes that 2P - 1 is
a Mersenne prime, notes that 8 p - 2 == 2(p+1)/2 or _2(p+1)/2 mod 2P - 1
and asks: which? Selfridge observes that the problem was asked in 1954
by Raphael Robinson. In a 94-06-22 email, Franz Lemmermeier provides
much evidence, later further strengthened by Robert Harley, that if 2P - 1
is written in the form 4a 2 + 27b2 , then the sign is that of the Jacobi symbol
 (~) (see F5). Sun Zhi-Hong had made a similar conjecture on 88-09-19.
     Selfridge conjectures that if n is a prime of the form 2k ± 1 or 22k ±3, then
2 n - 1 and (2n + 1)/3 are either both prime or both composite. Moreover
if both are prime, then n is of one of those forms. Is this an example of the
Law of Small Numbers? Dickson, on p. 28 of Vol. 1 of his History, says:

         In a letter to Tannery (l'Intermediaire des math., 2(1895)
      317) Lucas stated that Mersenne (1644, 1647) implied that a
      necessary and sufficient condition that 2P - 1 be a prime is that
      p be a prime of one of the forms 22n + 1, 2 2n ± 3, 2 2n+ 1 - 1.
      Tannery expressed his belief that the theorem was empirical
      and due to Frenicle, rather than to Fermat.

     If p is a prime, is 2P - 1 always squarefree (does it never contain a
repeated factor)? This seems to be another unanswerable question. It
is safe to conjecture that the answer is "No!" This could be settled by
computer if you were lucky. As D. H. Lehmer has said about various
factoring methods, "Happiness is just around the corner". Selfridge puts
the computational difficulties in perspective by proposing the problem: find
fifty more numbers like 1093 and 3511. [Fermat's theorem tells us that if p
is prime, then p divides 2P - 2. The primes 1093 and 3511 are the only two
less than 1.25 x 1015 (Josh Knauer & Jorg Richstein, May 2003) for which
p2 divides 2P - 2.] It is not known if there are infinitely many Wieferich
primes, p, for which p2 divides 2P - 2. It is not even known if there are
infinitely many p for which p2 does not divide 2P - 2 - although Silverman
deduced this from the very powerful "ABC conjecture" (see B19) and
Ribenboim has extended this to other second order recurring sequences.
Karl Dilcher reports that 31093 == 3 (mod 10932 + 1093 + 1).

    The so-called repunits, (lOP - 1)/9, are prime for p = 2, 19, 23, 317,
1031 and probably 49081. Repunits other than 1 are known never to be
squares and Rotkiewicz has shown that they are not cubes. When are they
squarefree? The primes 3, 487 and 56598313 are the only ones less than
232 for which p2 divides lOP - 10. Peter Montgomery lists cases where p2
divides aP - 1 - 1 for a < 100 and p < 232.
    Repunits are the simplest example of palindromes, which read the
same backwards as forwards.
    Dubner & Broadhurst found the 15601-digit palidromic prime

                 ,18080108081808010808
                                   ...

                                                     "
                       1808010808 repeated 1560 times


Which reads upside-down as well as back to front, yielding a 4-group of
symmetries. Broadhurst has also used repunits to create other curiosities.
For example, with Rn = (IOn - 1)/9, he announced on 2003-06-23 that
       [7532· 10 14 . R2160/ R4 + 75753575332572] . R26088/ R2174 + 1
is a palindromic prime with each its 26088 digits prime, and on 2003-08-05
he beat his own record with the 30913-digit specimen
                 34· R30912 - 1 - c· 101266 . R30912/ R 2576
where c = 400440004440040044000000000440040044400044004.
    Charles Nicol and John Selfridge ask if the sequence of concatenations
of the natural numbers in base 10,
     1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345, 123456, 1234567, 12345678, 123456789,
contains infinitely many primes. Robert Baillie has found that there are
no such primes out to n = 1000. Nicol & Mike Filaseta find that the first
prime among the reverse concatenations is
                     82818079787776···1110987654321
    The questions can also be asked for other scales of notation; for example
123456101112137 = 13187066607710 is prime.
    It is hard to put an upper bound on the number of questions that one
may ask about the digits of primes. De Koninck asks for a proof that for
k ~ 2, k not a multiple of 3, there is always a prime whose (decimal) digits
sum to k, and that for k ~ 4 there are infinitely many such. If p(k) is the
smallest prime with digital sum k, is p(k) == 9 (mod 10) for k > 25? Is it
== 99 (mod 100) for k > 38? And == 999 (mod 1000) for k > 59?
    David Wilson asks if there are infinitely many deletable primes, i.e.,
primes from which a decimal digit may be deleted, leaving either the
empty set or another deletable prime. If so, what proportion of primes
are deletable? Here are the first sixty deletable primes:

     Richard McIntosh notes that the largest known prime of shape n
(2 4p + 1) /17 has p = 317 and that n is composite for all primes p with
317 < p < 10000. Are there any more such primes?
    Wagstaff observes that the only primes < 180 for which (pP -1)/(p-1)
is prime are p = 2, 3, 19 and 31; for (pP + 1)/(P + 1) they are p = 3, 5,
17 and 157. In our second edition it was misstated that (77 - 1)/(7 - 1) is
prime.
     The Fermat numbers, Fn = 2 2n + 1 are also of continuing interest;
they are prime for 0 ~ n ~ 4 and composite for 5 ~ n ~ 32 and for
many larger values of n. Hardy & Wright give a heuristic argument which
suggests that only a finite number of them are prime.
    It has been conjectured that the Fermat numbers are squarefree. It was
verified by Gostin & McLaughlin that 82 of the 85 then known factors of the
71 known composite Fermat numbers were not repeated. At least 250 prime
factors of 214 different Fermat numbers are now known. Lenstra, Lenstra,
Manasse & Pollard have completely factored the ninth, and R. P. Brent the
eleventh, Fermat number. The author has bet John Conway that another
Fermat number will be completely factored before 2016-09-30. If not, he
pays up on his 100th birthday, so, to echo Sam Wagstaff, keep those factors
coming!

    Because of their special interest as potential factors of Fermat numbers,
and because proofs of their primality are comparatively easy, numbers of
the form k . 2n + 1 have received special attention, at least for small values
of k. For example, large primes were found by Harvey Dubner and Wilfrid
Keller, the record on 84-09-05 for a non-Mersenne prime being (k, n) =
(5,23473) by Keller. Another of his discoveries, (k, n) = (289,18502) is
amusing in that it may be written as (18496,18496), a Cullen prime (B20)
and as (17.2 9251 )2 + 1, a prime of shape a 2 + 1 (AI).

    As we mentioned, the record has since been beaten with a prime of
shape k . 2n - 1 with (k, n) = (391581,216193). See also B21.
    On 2003-02-22 John Cosgrave discovered that 3 . 22145353 + 1 divides
F2145351. This was the largest known prime that is not a Mersenne prime,
but on 2003-10-12 he found that 3.22478785 + 1 divides F2478782.
    Hugh Williams has found, for r = 3, 5, 7 and 11, all values of n :::; 500
for which (r - l)rn - 1 is prime:

   r=3    n= 1,2,3,7,8,12,20,23,27,35,56,62,68,131,222,384,387

   r = 11 n= 1,3,37,119,255,355,371,497

    Pi Xin-Ming found the generalized Fermat prime 16321024 + l.
    The only known primes of shape nn + (n+1)n are 3, 13 and 881; since n
must be a power of 2, the analogy with Fermat primes suggests that there
are no more; there are no others with n < 215 . Cino Hilliard reports that
(n+1)n - nn-1 is prime for n = 2, 5, 6, 9, 24; and (n+1)n +nn-1 for n = 2,
3, 8, 9, 15, 16, 219.
    We are very unlikely to know for sure that the Fibonacci sequence
         1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597, ... ,
where U1 = U2 = 1 and U r +1 = U r + U r -1, contains infinitely many primes.
Similarly for the related Lucas sequence

183089, 193201, 202667 (the last ten being only 'probable primes'). It
is believed that most Lucas Lehmer sequence@Lucas-Lehmer sequences
defined by second-order recurrence relations with U1 .1 U2 also contain an
infinity of primes. However, Graham has shown that the sequence with
               Uo = 1786 772701 928802 632268 715130 455793
               U1 = 1059 683225 053915 111058 165141 686995

A4 The prime number race.
A number a is said to be congruent to c, modulo a positive number
b, written a == c mod b, if b is a divisor of a-c. S. Chowla conjectured
that if a -.l b, then there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes
such that Pn == Pn+1 == a mod b. The case b = 4, a = 1 follows from a
theorem of Littlewood. Bounds between which such consecutive primes
occur have been given in this case, and for b = 4, a = 3 by Knapowski &
Thnin. Thnin observed that it would be of interest (in connexion with the
Riemann hypothesis, for example) to discover long sequences of consecutive
primes == 1 mod 4. Den Haan found the nine primes
     11593, 1159~ 1161~ 11621, 11633, 1165~ 1167~ 11681, 11689.
     Four sequences of 10 such primes end at 373777, 495461, 509521 and
612217 and a sequence of 11 ends at 766373. Stephane Vandemergel has
discovered no fewer than 16 consecutive primes of shape 4k + 1; They are
207622000+273,297,301,313,321, 381,409,417,421,489, 501, 517, 537,
549, 553, 56l.
     Thirteen consecutive primes congruent to 3 mod 4 are 241000 + 603,
639, 643, 651, 663, 667, 679, 687, 691, 711, 727, 739 and 77l.
     If p(b, a) is the least prime in the arithmetic progression a + nb, with
a -.l b, then Linnik showed that there is a constant L, now called Linnik's
constant such that p(b, a) «: bL . Pan Cheng-Thng, Chen Jing-Run, Matti
Jutila, Chen Jing-Run, Matti Jutila, S. Graham, Chen Jing-Run, Chen
Jing-Run & Liu Jian-Min, and Wang Wei3 have successively improved the
best known value of L to 5448, 777, 550, 168, 80, 36, 17, 13.5, and 8, and
Heath-Brown has recently established the remarkable result L :S 5.5.
     Elliott & Halberstam have shown that

                           p(b, a) < ¢(b)(1nb)lH

almost always.
   In the other direction it is known (see the papers of Prachar, Schinzel
and Pomerance) that, given a, there are infinitely many values of b for
which
                      (b )      cb In b In In b In In In In b
                     p ,a >            (Inlnlnb)2

where c is an absolute constant.
     Thran was particularly interested in the prime number race. Let
7r( n; a, b) be the number of primes p ::; n, p == a mod b. Is it true that for
every a and b with a -.l b, there are infinitely many values of n for which

                               7r(n;a,b) > 7r(n;aI, b)

for every al t= a mod b? Knapowski & Thran settled special cases, but the
general problem is wide open.
    Chebyshev noted that 7r(n; 1,3) < 7r(n; 2, 3) and 7r(n; 1,4) ::; 7r(n; 3, 4)
for small values of n. Leech, and independently Shanks & Wrench, dis-
covered that the latter inequality is reversed for n = 26861 and Bays &
Hudson that the former is reversed for two sets, each of more than 150
million integers, between n = 608981813029 and n = 610968213796.
    Bays & Hudson found that 7r(n; 1,4) > 7r(n; 3, 4) for n = 1488478427089.
    Bach & Sorenson have shown, under the assumption of the generalized
lliemann hypothesis, that if m, q are integers with m -.l q, then then there
is a prime p == m mod q satisfying p < 1.7(qlnq)2.
    Carlos B. Rivera F. has found 19 consecutive primes of shape 4k + 1:
297779117 +4c for c = 0, 11, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 24, 33, 45, 48, 53, 56, 69, 71,
80, 90, 98, 99, and 20 consecutive primes of shape 4k - 1: 727334879 + 4c
for c = 0, 2, 3, 5, 15, 21, 26, 36, 38, 50, 51, 57, 62, 63, 71, 83, 87, 117, 120,

A5 Arithmetic progressions of primes.
How long can an arithmetic progression be which consists only of primes?
Table 1 shows progressions of n primes, a, a+d, ... , a+(n-l)d, discovered
by James Fry, V.A. Golubev, Andrew Moran, Paul Pritchard, S.C. Root,
W.N. Seredinskii, S. Weintraub, Jeff Young and Anthony Thyssen (see
the first edition for earlier, smaller discoveries). Of course, the common
difference must have every prime p ::; n as a divisor (unless n = a). It is
conjectured that n can be as large as you like. This would follow if it were
possible to improve Szemeredi's theorem (see EIO).
    STOP PRESS (04-04-09): Ben Green & Terence Tao have made just
such an improvement, and it seems virtually certain that they have proved
that you can indeed have arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of primes.
    More generally, Erdos conjectures that if {ad is any infinite sequence
of integers for which 2: l/ai is divergent, then the sequence contains ar-
bitrarily long arithmetic progressions. He offered $3000.00 for a proof or
disproof of this conjecture.
    In 1993 Paul Pritchard coordinated an effort which discovered 22 primes
in arithmetic progression, starting with a = 11410337850553 and having
common difference d = 4609098694200,i.e., a + 21d = 108201410428753.

term q and length q. Examples are (q, d) = (7,150), (11, 1536160080) and
(13, 9918821194590). On 2001-11-07 Phil Carmody announced his find of

    Pomerance produces the "prime number graph" by plotting the points
(n,Pn) and shows that for every k we can find k primes whose points are
collinear.
    Grosswald has shown that there are long arithmetic progressions con-
sisting only of almost primes, in the following sense. There are infinitely
many arithmetic progressions of k terms, each term being the product of
at most r primes, where

                                                  J.
                         r :::; Lkin k + 0.892k + 1

He has also shown that the Hardy-Littlewood estimate is of the right order
of magnitude for 3-term arithmetic progressions of primes.
   Jim Fougeron & Hans Rosenthal have found a 7-term AP of 1286-digit
primes, (260708115 + 31232070k) ·3001# + 1 for k = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, where
3001# means the product of all the primes from 2 to 3001.

A6 Consecutive primes in A.P.
It has even been conjectured that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic
progressions of consecutive primes, such as

                 251,257,263,269          and      1741,1747,1753,1759.

Jones, Lal & Blundon discovered the sequence 1010 + 24493 + 30k
(0 ~ k ~ 4) of five consecutive primes, and Lander & Parkin, soon after,
found six such primes, 121174811 + 30k (0 ~ k ~ 5). They also established
that 9843019 + 30k (0 ~ k ~ 4) is the least progression of five terms, that
there are 25 others less than 3 . 108 , but no others of length six.
    On 95-09-15 Harvey Dubner emailed that he & Harry Nelson had re-
cently found 7 consecutive primes in arithmetic progression. The common
difference is 210, and the first prime is x + N m + 1 where m is the product
of the first 48 primes,

    In Nov 1997 Harvey Dubner, Tony Forbes, Nik Lygeros, Michel Mizony
& Paul Zimmermann announced that they had found 8 consecutive primes
in AP. On 98-01-15, Manfred Toplic informed Harvey Dubner, Tony Forbes,
Paul Zimmermann, Nik Lygeros & Michel Mizony that their project, which
involved about 100 people using about 200 computers and took about two
months, was a success, and that he had just found 9 consecutive primes in
A.P. On 98-03-02, Paul Zimmermann said "we've just found 10 consecutive
primes in arithmetic progression, the first one being (93 digits)
10099697246971424763 778665558 796984032950932468919004180360341 7758904341 70334888215906 7229719

with common difference 210. It was the same team as that for 9 primes in
January, with about 100 helpers all around the world."
    It is not known if there are infinitely many sets of three consecutive
primes in arithmetic progression, but S. Chowla has demonstrated this
without the restriction to consecutive primes. Schinzel writes that Chowla
was anticipated by van der Corput.
    Harry Nelson has collected the $100.00 prize that Martin Gardner of-
fered to the first discoverer of a 3 x 3 magic square whose nine entries
are consecutive primes. These are not in arithmetic progression, of course.
The central prime is 1480028171 and the others are this ±12, ±18, ±30
and ±42. He found more than 20 other such squares.
    On 2002-08-25 David Wilson sent a 3 x 3 magic square with all prime
entries and minimal row sum 177.

A 7 Cunningham chains.
Primes p such that 2p + 1 is also prime are known as Sophie Germain
primes. It is believed, but not known, that there are infinitely many. Dub-
ner has found such primes, of form 3003c . lOb - 1 for (c, b) = (7014,2110),
(581436,2581), (15655515,2999), (5199545,3529), (488964,4003) and
(1803301,4526). Indlekofer & Jarai (ref. at AS) found a Sophie Germain
prime with 5847 decimal digits, and, on 2002-08-22 Michael Angel, Dirk Au-
gustin & Paul Jobling gave the 24432-digit specimen 1213822389.281131 _1.
    A common method for proving that p is a prime involves the factor-
ization of p - 1. If p - 1 = 2q, where q is another prime, the size of the
problem has only been reduced by a factor of 2, so it's interesting to observe
Cunningham chains of primes with each member one more than twice
the previous one. D. H. Lehmer found just three such chains of 7 primes
with least member < 107 :
     1122659, 2245319, 4490639, 8981279, 17962559,35925119, 71850239
  2164229,4328459,8656919, 17313839,34627679,69255359, 138510719
  2329469, 4658939, 9317879, 18635759, 37271519, 74543039, 149086079
and two others with least members 10257809 and 10309889. The factoriza-
tion of p + 1 can also be used to prove that p is prime. Lehmer found seven
chains of length 7 based on p + 1 = 2q. The first three had least members
16651,67651 and 165901, but the second of these must be discarded, since
the fifth member is 1082401 = 601 = 1801 (curiously, this is a divisor of
225 - 1).
    Lalout & Meeus found chains of length 8 of each kind, starting with
19099919 and 15514861, and these are the smallest of this length. Gunter
Loh has found many new chains: the least of length 9 start with 85864769
and 857095381; of length 10 with 26089808579 and 205528443121; of length
11 with 665043081119 and 1389122693971; of length 12 with 554688278429
and 216857744866621; and a chain of length 13 of the second kind starts
with 758083947856951. A count of all chains of the first kind starting below
1011 and of length 6, 7,8,9, 10 gave the respective frequencies 19991, 2359,
257,21,2.
    Warut Roonguthai found the Cunningham chain of length 3: p =
651358155 X 23291 - 1, 2p+1, 4p+3.
    Tony Forbes (see reference at A9) has found several chains oflength 15
and one of length 16, beginning with p = 3203000719597029781.

     Phil Carmody & Paul Jobling announced on 2002-03-01 that
810433818265726529160 . 2k - 1 is prime for 0 :S k :S 15.
     In 1969 Daniel Shanks wrote to D. H. & Emma Lehmer about quadratic
chains. Teske & Williams defined a Shanks chain of primes to be one
satisfying PHI = ap~ - b for 1 :S i < k and a, b are integers. They showed
that, for all but 56 pairs of a, b values with ab :S 1000, any corresponding
Shanks chain must have bounded length. Shanks's original suggestion of
PHI = 4p~ - 17 yields a 4-chain if PI = 3 and a 5-chain if PI = 303593, but
it 'can be seen (mod 59) that no such chain has length 17. It seems certain
that such chains cannot be of arbitrary length. Are there any of length 7?

A8 Gaps between primes. Twin primes.
There are many problems concerning the gaps between consecutive primes.
Write dn = Pn+I - Pn so that dl = 1 and all other dn are even. How large
and how small can dn be? Rankin has shown that

                        d        clnnlnlnnlnlnlnlnn
                            n>        (lnlnlnn)2

for infinitely many n and Erdos offers $5,000 for a proof or disproof that
the constant c can be taken arbitrarily large. Rankin's best value is c = e'
where 'Y is Euler's constant: Maier & Pomerance have improved this by a
factor k ~ 1.31256, the root of the equation 4/k - e- 4 / k = 3, and Pintz
has made a further improvement to c = 2e"Y > 3.562.
    It may be worth observing, since the multiplicity of In s occasionally
confuses, that, infinitely often, the gap dn exceeds the average gap, In n,
by an arbitrarily large factor, M, say. [Put n = ee M2 .J It's hard to believe
that there are infinitely many gaps > 10100 In n.
32                                     Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

    On 2004-01-07 Hans Rosenthal reported that a gap of 675034 between
two probabilistic primes can be found at
http://www.trnicely.net/gaps/g675034.html.
    R.C. Baker & Harman prove that Pn+1 - Pn «: p~.535, and, with Pintz,
improve the exponent to 0.525, improvements over Heath-Brown's 0.55.
    In March 2003, it was thought that Dan Goldston and Cern Yildirim
had proved that Pn+1 -Pn is infinitely often as small as (lnpn)4/5, but it was
subsequently discovered that an error term was large enough to invalidate
the result. Can their methods yield an improvement on our very limited
knowledge of this problem?
    A very famous conjecture is the Twin Prime Conjecture, that d n = 2
infinitely often. If n > 6, are there always twin primes between nand 2n?
Conjecture B of Hardy and Littlewood (cf. AI) is that Pk (n), the number
of pairs of primes less than n and differing by an even number k, is given
asymptotically by

                        Pk(n)   ~ (l!C:)2 II (: =~)
where the product is taken over all odd prime divisors of k (and so is empty
and taken to be 1 when k is a power of 2) and C = I1(l-l/(p -1)2) taken
over all odd primes, so that 2c ~ 1.32032. If 7l'1,2(n) is the number of
primes P such that P + 2 has at most two prime factors, then Fouvry &
Grupp have shown that
                                                 2cn
                            7l'1,2(n) ~ 0.71 x (lnn)2

and 0.71 has been improved to 1.015 by Liu and then to 1.05 by Wu.
   On p. 11 of the July 2002 London Math. Society's newsletter, A. A.
Mullin asks us to prove that there are infinitely many perfect squares which
exceed an odd bicomposite (product of two distinct primes) by 1.
   The large twin primes 9 . 2211 ± 1 were discovered by the Lehmers and
independently by Riesel. Crandall & Penk found twin primes with 64, 136,
154, 203 and 303 digits, Williams found 156.5202 ± 1, Baillie 297.2546 ± 1,
Atkin & Rickert
            694503810.2 2304 ± 1 and        1159142985.22304 ± 1
and in 1989 Brown, Noll, Parady, Smith, Smith & Zarantonello found
       663777.2 7650 ± 1,     571305.2 7701 ± 1,    1706595.211235 ± 1.

     On 93:08:16 Harvey Dubner announced a new record with
                  24025 .3.54020 ·7·11 . 13·79·223 ± 1,
numbers with 4030 decimal digits. Indlekofer & Jarai found 697053813 .
216352 ± 1 in November 1994, and a year later found the 11713-digit pair

242206083.238880 ± 1. Meanwhile, on 95-07-25, Tony Forbes had found
6797727 x 215328 ± 1.
    Jack Brennan noted that k·2 n ±1 were primes for k = 3·5·7·11·13·13487
and the twelve values n = 2, 12, 17, 28, 31, 33, 42, 55, 62, 86, 89, 91. Phil
Carmody found that k = 32 . 53 . 7 . 11 . 132 . 23 . 503 . 4129 gave 14 such
twins with n ~ 470 and that k = 3 . 5 . 7· 11 . 13 . 23 . 37 . 97 . 460891 gave
15 twins, with n = 1, 13, 15, 17, 18, 22, 29, 35, 39, 43, 60, 189, 385, 705,
979. His request for a set of 16 has not so far been answered.
    Richard Brent counted 224376048 primes p less than 1011 for which
p + 2 is also prime; about 9% more than predicted by Conjecture B. Nicely,
who, in course of his work cunningly detected the notorious Pentium chip
flaw, counted 135780321665 twin prime pairs < 10 14 , the sum of whose
reciprocals is

     B(10 14 ) = 1.82024496813027052889471783861953382834649 ....

Brun showed that the sum of the reciprocals of twin primes is convergent,
to sum B, say. Nicely estimates

                       B = 1.9021605778 ± 2.1 x 10- 9

and, based on a subsequent calculation to 2.5 x 10 14 ,

                       B = 1.9021605803 ± 1.3 x 10-9

Pascal Sebah's August 2002 calculation of 1f2(10 16 )         10304195697298
yields B = 1.902160583104 ....
    Bombieri & Davenport have shown that

                      lim inf ldn < 2 + J3 ~ 0.46650
                               nn      8
(no doubt the real answer is zero; of course the truth of the Twin Prime
Conjecture would imply this); G.Z. Pilt'Yal has improved the constant on
the right to (2V2 - 1)/4 ~ 0.45711; Uchiyama to (9 - J3)/16 ~ 0.454256;
Huxley to (4 sin 0 + 30)/(16 sinO) ~ 0.44254, where 0 + sinO = 1f/4, and
later to 0.4394; and Helmut Maier to 0.248.
    Huxley has also shown that

                                dn < p7/12+€
                                      n      ,

Heath-Brown & Iwaniec have improved the exponent to 11/20; Mozzochi
to 0.548; and Lou & Yao to 6/11. Cramer proved, using the Riemann
hypothesis, that
                              L
                            d~ < cx(lnx)4.

34                                    Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

Erdos conjectures that the right-hand side should be cx(In x)2, but thinks
that there is no hope of a proof. The Riemann hypothesis implies that
dn < Pn   1/2+€
                .
      A. S. Peck shows that the sum E dn of those dn which are> n, taken
over the interval x ::;: Pn ::;: 2x is «: x 25 / 36+€, improving on Heath-Brown's
previous best exponent of 3/4.
      Jie Wu shows that if () > 0.973, then the number of primes P in the
interval [x, x + xlJ] such that P + 2 has at most two prime factors is at least
ex lJ / (In X)2. Salerno & Vitolo have a similar result.
      Sandor has shown that liminfn - Hxl 5n{y'Pn+l - ..;p;;) = 0 and that
liminfndn _ 1 {d n /Pn)2 = O.
      Erdos & Nathanson show that
                           00             1
                          ~ n{lnlnn)c{Pn+l - Pn)
converges for c > 2 and conjecture that it diverges for e = 2,
   Dorin Andrica conjectures that, for all natural n,

                                                        ?

Dan Grecu has verified this for Pn < 106 • In Amer. Math. Monthly,
83(1976) 61, it is given as a difficult unsolved problem that

                    i       lim (y'Pn+1 - ..;p;;) = 0       ?
                           n-+oo


If true, this implies Andrica's conjecture for large enough n, which, is
comparable with that of Cramer, mentioned in A2, and with the following
one of Shanks, who has given a heuristic argument which supports the
conjecture that if p{g) is the first prime that follows a gap of 9 between
consecutive primes, then lnp{g) rv .;g. Record gaps between consecutive
primes have been observed by Lehmer, Lander & Parkin, Brent, Weintraub,
Young & PotIer and others. Table 2 illustrates Shanks's conjecture. The
last several entries are taken from T. R. Nicely's web page
http://www.trnicely.net/gaps .
    On 2001-12-13 Harvey Dubner found a gap of 119738 between two 3396-
digit primes; on 2003-02-15 Marcel Martin announced that Jose Luis Gomez
Pardo had proved the primality of a 5878-digit number which is the upper
bound of a gap of size 233822; and on 2004-01-15 Andersen & Rosenthal
announced a prime gap of 1001548 between two probabilistic primes with
43429 digits.
    Chen Jing-Run showed that, for x large enough, there is always a num-
ber with at most two prime factors in the interval [x - xCI!, x] for any value
of a ~ 0.477. Halberstam, Heath-Brown & Richert (see reference at A5)
showed that in such an interval with a = 0.455 there are at least xCI! /121ln x
A. Prime Numbers                                                        35


numbers with at most two prime factors, and Iwaniec & Laborde reduced
the exponent to 0: = 0.45. Further improvements to the value of 0: are
0.4436 (Fouvry), 0.44 (Wu), 0.4386 (Li) and 0.436 (Liu).




    Victor Meally used the phrase prime deserts. He notes that below
373 the commonest gap is 2; below 467 there are 24 gaps of each of 2, 4 and
6; below 563 the commonest gap is 6, as it is between 10 14 and 1014 + 108
and probably also from 2 to 1014 . He asks: when does 30 take over as the
commonest gap?




     Conway & Odlyzko call d a champion for x if it occurs most frequently
as the difference between consective primes :S x. There may be more than
one champion for the same x: C(135) = 4, C(100) = {2,4}. They suggest
that the only champions are 4 and the prime factorials 2, 6, 30, 210, 2310,
. .. . Do champions ~ oo? Does each prime p divide all champions for
x ~ xo(P)?

     A cluster prime p is one such that every even number less than p - 2
is the difference of two primes both :S p. The first 23 odd primes, 3, 5, 7,
... , 89 are all cluster primes. The smallest non-cluster prime is 97 (88 is
not the difference of two primes :S 97). Blecksmith & Selfridge ask if there
are infinitely many cluster primes.
     Maier & Stewart have shown that there are long intervals which contain
fewer primes than the average for intervals of such length.

A9 Patterns of primes.
A conjecture more general than Chowla's (see A4) is that there are in-
finitely many sets of consecutive primes of any given pattern, provided
that there are no congruence relations which rule them out. It seems likely,
for example, that there are infinitely many triples of primes
{6k - 1, 6k + 1, 6k + 5} and {6k + 1, 6k + 5, 6k + 7}. This would be even
harder to settle than the Twin Prime Conjecture, but its plausibility is of
interest, since Hensley & Richards have shown that it is incompatible with
the well-known conjecture (also due to Hardy & Littlewood)

                           7r(X + y) ::; 7r(x) + 7r(Y)    ???
for all integers x, y 2: 2. We've put more queries than usual round this,
since it is very likely to be false. Indeed, there's some hope of finding values
of x and y which contradict it. However there's an alternative conjecture,

                         7r(X + y) ::; 7r(x) + 27r(y/2)    ?
that the Hensley-Richards method doesn't comment on.
   Montgomery & Vaughan showed that

                         7r(X + y) - 7r(x) ::; 2y/lny

and Iwaniec observed that for each 0, 0 < 0 < 1, there is an ",(0) > 0 such
that
                7r(X + x o) - 7r(x) < (2 + E)XO /(1J(O) lnx)
for sufficiently large x and he found that 1J(O) = ~O - ~ for 0 > ~, and that
1J(O) = (1 + 0)/2 for 0 > ~. Lou & Yao improve this in part by showing
that 1J(O) = (1000 - 45)/11 for 161 < 0 ::; ~~.
    On 2002-08-20 David Broadhurst announced that the number N =
(kn(n + 1) + 21O)(n - 1)/35 with k = 61504372896 and n = 5119 times
the product of all primes not exceeding 3163, yields the three 4019-digit
primes N + 5, N + 7, N + 11.
    C. W. Trigg reported that in 1978 M. A. Penk found four primes p,
p + 2, p + 6 and p + 8 where
         p=802359150003121605557551380867519560344356971.
   H. F. Smith noted that the pattern 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37 is
repeated at least three times, starting with the primes 15760091, 25658841
and 93625991. In none of these cases is the number corresponding to 41 a
prime, although n -11, n -13, ... n - 41 are all primes for n = 88830 and
855750.
   Leech gave as an unsolved problem to find 33 consecutive numbers
greater than 11 which include 10 primes. In 1961 Herschel Smith found
A. Prime Numbers                                                               41


20 such sets and also 5 examples of 37 consecutive numbers containing 11
primes. Smith writes that Selfridge noted some errors in his 1957 paper.
Sten Safholm found primes

                {n + 11, ... ,n + 43} for n = 33081664140

and rediscovered Smith's first three examples, that each of

           {n - 11, ... ,n - 43} is prime for n = 9853497780,

for n = 21956291910 and for n = 22741837860. Leech wondered why the
latter sets seem to occur more readily than the former. My guess is that
this is just a more complicated version of the prime number race (see A4)
and that with much more high-powered telescopes we'd see the balance
being redressed (infinitely often). Dimitrios Betsis & Sten Safholm have
found many more patterns, culminating in {n + 11, ... ,n + 61} for n =
21817283854511250 and {n - 11, ... ,n - 61} for n = 79287805466244270.
Two large prime 15-plets were found over Sep-Oct 2003 by Jens Kruse
Andersen. Add the 15 primes from 11 to 67 to either of the numbers
1251030012595955901312188450370 or 1100916249233879857334075234820.

    Warut Roonguthai searched for the smallest n-digit prime P = lOn-l+k
such that P + 2, P + 6 and P + 8 are also prime, i.e., {p,p + 2,p + 6,p + 8}
is the smallest n-digit prime quadruplet:
     n     100          200             300         400           500
      k 349781731 21156403891 140159459341 34993836001 883750143961
    In none of these cases is p + 12 or p - 4 a prime.
    Erdos asks, for each k, what is the smallest l for which Pk, Pk+I, ... ,
Pk+l-I is the only set of l consecutive primes with this pattern. E.g., the
pattern 3, 5, 7 cannot occur again. The pattern 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 repeats at
101, 103, 107, 109, 113 and no doubt occurs infinitely often, But consid-
erations mod 5 show that the pattern 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 does not occur
again. (Pk, l) = (2,2), (3,3), (5,6), ....

AIO Gilbreath's conjecture.
Define d~ by d;, = dn and d~+l = Id~+1 - d~l, that is, the successive
absolute differences of the sequence of primes (Figure 2). N. L. Gilbreath
conjectured (and Hugh Williams notes that Proth, long before, claimed to
have proved) that d~ = 1 for all k. This was verified for k < 63419 by
Killgrove & Ralston. Odlyzko has checked it for primes up to 71"(10 13 ) ~
3 . 1011; he only needed to examine the first 635 differences.

    Hallard Croft and others have suggested that it has nothing to do with
primes as such, but will be true for any sequence consisting of 2 and odd
numbers, which doesn't increase too fast, or have too large gaps. Odlyzko
discusses this.

All Increasing and decreasing gaps.
Since the proportion of primes gradually decreases, albeit somewhat errat-
ically, dm < dm +1 infinitely often, and Erdos & Turan have shown that the
same is true for d n > d n +1. They have also shown that the values of n for
which d n > d n +1 have positive lower density, but it is not known if there
are infinitely many decreasing or increasing sets of three consecutive values
of dn . If there were not, then there is an no so that for every i and n > no
we have dn+2i > dn+2i+1 and dn+2i +1 < dn+2i+2. Erdos offers $100.00 for
a proof that such an no does not exist. He and Tunln could not even prove
that for k > k o, (-It(dk+r+1 - dk+r) can't always have the same sign.

A12 Pseudoprimes. Euler pseudoprimes.
Strong pseudoprimes.
Pomerance, Selfridge & Wagstaff call an odd composite n for which
an- 1 == 1 mod n a pseudoprime to base a (psp(a)). This usage is
introduced to avoid the clumsy "composite pseudoprime" which appears
throughout the literature. Odd composite n which are psp(a) for ev-
ery a prime to n are Carmichael numbers (see Al3). An odd com-
posite n is an Euler pseudoprime to base a (epsp( a)) if a -'- nand
a(n-l)/2 == (;) mod n, where (;) is the Jacobi symbol (see F5). Finally,
an odd composite n with n - 1 = d· 28 , d odd, is a strong pseuodoprime
to base a (spsp(a)) if ad == 1 mod n (otherwise ad.2r == -1 mod n for some
r, 0::; r < s). These definitions are illustrated by a Venn diagram (Figure
3) which displays the smallest member of each set.

    The following values of P2(X), E2(X), S2(X) and C(x) - the numbers of
psp(2), epsp(2), spsp(2) and Carmichael numbers less than x, respectively
- were given by Pomerance, Selfridge & Wagstaff and extended to 10 13 by
Pinch, who makes some random observations: the only twin pseudoprimes
up to 1013 are 4369,4371: there are 54 non-squarefree pseudoprimes up to
10 13 - all multiples of 1194649 = 10932 or 12327121 = 3511 2 ; and asks
are there any other square psp?

ture that 3825123056546413051 = 149491·747451·34233211 is the candidate
for k = 9, 10 and II.
    Lehmer and Erdos showed that, for sufficiently large x,

                cdnx < P2(X) < x exp{ -c2(lnx lnlnx)I/2}

and Pomerance improved these bounds to

        exp{(lnx)5/I4} < P2 (x) < xexp{(-lnxlnlnlnx)/2Inlnx}

and has a heuristic argument that the true estimate is the upper bound
with the 2 omitted. The exponent 5/14 has been improved to 85/207 by
Pomerance, using a result of Friedlander.
    There are also examples of even numbers such that 2n == 2 mod n.
Lehmer found 161038 = 2·73· 1103 and Beeger showed that there are
infinitely many. The next few are 215326, 2568226, 3020626, 7866046,
9115426,49699666,143742226, ...
    If Fn is the Fermat number 22n + 1, Cipolla showed that Fnl Fn2 ... Fnk
is psp(2) if k > 1 and ni < n2 < ... < nk < 2nl.
    If p~a) is the n-th psp(a), Szymiczek has shown that 2: 1/p~2) is conver-
gent, while Ml}kowski has shown that 2: 1/ In p~a) is divergent. Rotkiewicz
has a booklet on pseudoprimes which contains 58 problems and 20 conjec-
tures.
     For example, Problem #22 asks if there is a pseudoprime of form 2N - 2.
Wayne McDaniel answers this affirmatively with N = 465794. Rotkiewicz
has shown that the congruence 2n - 2 == 1 mod n has infinitely many com-
posite solutions n. Shen Mok-Kong found five such less than a million,
each of which ended in 7. McDaniel and Zhang Ming-Zhi have given the
examples 73 . 48544121 and 524287 . 13264529 which each show that 3 is
also a possible final digit.
     Selfridge, Wagstaff & Pomerance offer $500.00 + $100.00 + $20.00 for a
composite n == 3 or 7 mod 10 which divides both 2n - 2 and the Fibonacci
number un+1 (see A3) or $20.00 + $100.00 + $500.00 for a proofthat there
is no such n.
     Shen Mok-Kong has shown that there are infinitely many k such that
2n - k == 1 mod n has infinitely many composite solutions n, and Kiss &
Phong have shown that this is so for all k 2:: 2 and for all a 2:: 2 in place of
2.
     The Lucas sequence Vn = Vn(b, c) associated with the pair (b, c) is
given by Vo = 2, VI = b, Vn+2 = bVn+1 - cVn . For every prime p and
integer m, Vp(m, -1) == m (mod p). An odd composite integer n with
Vn(m, -1) == m (mod n) is a Fibonacci pseudoprime of the m-th kind.
A strong Fibonacci pseudoprime is a Fibonacci pseudoprime of the
m-th kind for all m. To be a strong Fibonacci pseudoprime, n must be
46                                   Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

squarefree, and p-l must divide n-l for each p that divides n, so that n
must be a Carmichael number [AI3].
    Somer shows that if an even Fibonacci pseudoprime exists, it is > 28 .
10 12 .
    Richard Pinch has found the smallest strong Dickson pseudoprime with
parameter c = -1 to be 17·31·41· 43·89·97 ·167·331.
    Interesting is the Perrin sequence,

     ao = 3,0,2,3,2,5,5,7,10,12,17,22,29,39,51,68,90,119,158,209, ...
generated by the cubic recurrence an+3 = an +an+1, which has the property
that p divides a p whenever p is prime. This gives rise to the concept of
Perrin pseudoprime; the first two such are 271441 = 521 2 and 904631 =
7 ·13·9941. Adams & Shanks give a more restrictive definition (not satisfied
by 271441 or 904631) and partitioned them into classes S, I and Q. Kurtz,
Shanks & Williams listed the 55 S-Perrin pseudoprimes < 109 and Arno
showed that there were none of type I or Q < 10 14 . If L > 0 and M =I- 0
are coprime and a, 13 are the roots of Z2 - VLz + M, define D = L - 4M
and the Lehmer sequences Pn = (an - f3n)/(a e - f3e) where e = 1 or 2
according as n is odd or even, and Vn = (an + f3n) / (a + (3)2-e. For each n
define d and s by n - ( r:,L) = d· 28 with d odd. An odd composite number
n is a strong Lehmer pseudoprime for the bases a and 13 if n -L D L and
either n divides Pd or n divides Vd.2r for some r, 0 ::; r < s. Rotkiewicz
proves that if a/f3 is not a root of unity, then every A.P. ax + b with a -L b
contains infinitely many odd strong Lehmer pseudoprimes for the bases a
and 13.
    Stan Wagon notices, in Daniel Bleichenbacher's list of pseudoprimes to
10 17 , the example n = 134670080641 = 211873·635617, which is a k-strong
pseudoprime for k = 2, 3 and 5, but not for k = 6. So, the first 'strong
pseudoprime witness' to the composite nature of n is 6, which is not a
prime.
    Shyam Sunder Gupta is interested in palindromic pseudoprimes, base 2.
These include 101101, 129921, 1837381, of which the first is a Carmichael
number. In March & October 2002 he adds 127665878878566721 and
1037998220228997301 = 41 . 101 ·211 . 251·757·1321·4733

A13 Carmichael numbers.
The Carmichael numbers (psp( a) for all a prime to n, n composite) must be
the product of at least three odd prime factors. As long ago as 1899 Korselt
had given a necessary and sufficient condition for n to be a Carmichael
number; namely that n be squarefree and such that (p - 1) I(n - 1) for each
p that divides n. The smallest example is 561 = 3 . 11 . 17. More generally,
if p = 6k + 1, q = 12k + 1 and r = 18k + 1 are each prime, then pqr is a
Carmichael number. It seems certain that there are infinitely many such
triples· of primes, but beyond our means to prove it. Alford, Granville &
Pomerance have shown (by a different method!) that there are infinitely
many Carmichael numbers, in fact, for sufficiently large x, more than xf3
of them less than x, where

                    f3 = -  5(1 - -2y'e1) > 0.290306 > -27
                            12

Erdos had conjectured that (In C (x)) / In x tends to 1 as x tends to infinity
and he improved a result of Knodel to show that

                   C(x) < xexp{-clnxlnlnlnx/lnlnx}.

Then Pomerance, Selfridge & Wagstaff (see A12) proved this with c = l-E
and give a heuristic argument supporting the conjecture that the reverse
inequality holds with c = 2 + E.
    They found 2163 Carmichael numbers < 25 . 109 and Jaeschke finds
6075 more between that bound and 1012 ; seven of these have eight prime
factors. Richard Pinch has corrected these counts to

J. R. Hill found the large Carmichael number pqr where p = 5.10 19 + 371,
q = 2p - 1 and r = 1 + (p - 1)(q + 2)/433. Wagstaff produced a 321-
digit example, and Woods & Huenemann one of 432 digits. Dubner has
continued to beat this and his own records, a 3710-digit specimen being
N = PQ R where P = 6M + 1, Q = 12M + 1 and R = 1 + (PQ - 1) / X are
primes given by M = (TC - I)A /4, T the product of the odd primes up
to 47, C = 141847, A = 41 and X = 123165. But Gunter Loh & Wolfgang
Niebuhr have developed new algorithms which completely eclipse these by
producing a Carmichael number with no fewer than 1101518 prime factors,
a number of 16142049 decimal digits!
    David Broadhurst has found a 60351-digit Carmichael number with
the minimum number, three, of prime factors, eclipsing Carmody's ear-
lier 30052-digit record. Harvey Dubner found a 3003-digit 4-component
specimen, eclipsing the previous 1093 digits.
    Alford, Granville & Pomerance proved that there are infinitely many
Carmichael numbers n with the stronger requirement that pin implies that
(p2 _ 1) I(n - 1), but didn't know of any examples. Sid Graham found 18
such numbers, the smallest being


5893983289990395334700037072001 = 29·31·37·43·53·67·79·89·97·151·181·191·419·881·883

Richard Pinch had already found the smallest of all:

            443372888629441 = 17· 31 ·41 . 43 . 89 . 97 . 167 . 331

Graham found 17 other numbers that satisfy the slightly weaker condition
P2;1 I (n - 1).
    Granville conjectures that if C k (x) is the number of Carmichael numbers
with k prime factors, then Ck(X) « X1 / k+ o (l) as x ----t 00. Balasubramanian
& Nataraj show that C 3 (x) « X 5 / 14+ o (I).
    Marko shows that for each k 2: 3 Schinzel's conjecture (see A2) implies
that there are infinitely many Carmichael numbers with k distinct prime
factors.
    Pinch lists one more Carmichael number with 6 prime factors and 2
more with 7 prime factors than does Jaesche, and discusses other discrep-
ancies with earlier tables. He asks if there is an n with pin implies both
p - 1 I n - 1 (so Carmichael) and p + 1 I n + 1. There is none up to
10 16 . And is it true that Ck(x), the number of Carmichael numbers up to
x with exactly k prime factors is 'essentially' xl/k, i.e., is bounded above
and below by this times powers of In x:

                   i.,   InCk(x) = (l/k)lnx+O(lnlnx)           ?

   Zhang Ming-Zhi found a Carmichael number with over a thousand
prime factors and Loh & Niebuhr raised this to more than a million. Alford

A14 "Good" primes and the prime number
graph.
Erdos and Straus called the prime Pn good if P; > Pn-iPn+i for all i,
1 ::; i ::; n - 1; for example, 5, 11, 17 and 29. Pomerance used the
"prime number graph" (see A5) to show that there are infinitely many
good primes. He asks the following questions. Is it true that the set of
n for which Pn is good has density O? Are there infinitely many n with
PnPn+l > Pn-iPn+Hi for all i, 1 ::; i ::; n - I? Are there infinitely many
n with Pn + Pn+l > Pn-i + Pn+Hi for all i, 1 ::; i ::; n - I? Does the
set of n for which 2Pn < Pn-i + Pn+i for all i, 1 ::; i ::; n - 1 have den-
sity O? (Pomerance proved that there were infinitely many such n.) Is
limsup{mino<i<n(Pn-i + Pn+i) - 2pn} = oo?
    Erdos has given another definition of good prime: call P good if every
even number 2r ::; P - 3 can be written as the difference of two primes not
greater than p. The first bad prime is 97. Selfridge & Blecksmith have
tables of good primes up to 1037 .

     OEIS: A028388, A046868-046869.



A15 Congruent products of consecutive
numbers.
Erdos, in a letter dated 79-10-31, observes that 3·4 == 5·6·7 == 1 mod 11
and asks for the least prime P such that there are integers a, kl' k2, k3 and

        kl          k2                k3
       II(a + i) == II(a + kl + i) == II(a + kl + k2 + i) == 1 mod p.
       i=l         i=l                i=l


He suggests that such primes P exist for any number of such congruent
products.
    Ml}kowski sends examples corresponding to rows n = 5 and 6 in the
table below [compare Fll] and says that tables of indices can be used to
find others. W. Narkiewicz also sends these examples, together with those
in rows n = 7,8 and 9 below. Landon Noll & Chuck Simmons generalize
the problem slightly by asking for solutions of




and they give the least prime P for which there is a solution with n terms.

A16 Gaussian and Eisenstein-Jacobi primes.
Prime numbers can be defined in fields other than the rational field. In the
complex number field they are called Gaussian primes. Many problems
on ordinary primes can be reformulated for Gaussian primes.
    Gaussian integers a+bi, where a, b are integers and i 2 = -1, behave
like ordinary integers in the sense that there is unique factorization
(apart from order, units (±1, ±i) and associates; the associates of 7, for
example, are 7, -7, 7i and -7i).
    Primes of shape 4k - 1, i.e., 3, 7, 11, 19, 23, ... , are still primes in the
ring of Gaussian integers, but the other ordinary primes can be factored
into Gaussian primes:

    2 = (1 + i)(1- i),         5 = (2 + i)(2 - i) = -(2i - 1)(21 + 1), etc.

13 = (2+3i)(2-3i),            17 = (4+i)(4-i),        29 = (5+2i)(5-2i), ...
The Gaussian primes ±1 ± i, ±1 ± 2i, ±2 ± i, ±3, ±3i, ±2 ± 3i, ±3 ± 2i,
±4 ± i, ±1 ± 4i, ±5 ± 2i, ±2 ± 5i, ... make a pleasing pattern (Figure 4)
when drawn on an Argand diagram, which has been used for tiling floors
and weaving tablecloths.
    Motzkin and Gordon asked if one can "walk" from the origin to infinity
using the Gaussian primes as "stepping stones" and taking steps of bounded
length. Presumably not. Jordan & Rabung have shown that steps of length
at least 4 are necessary.
    Gethner, Wagon & Wick have produced a moat of width J26.
    Haugland argues that a corresponding walk on the Eisenstein-Jacobi
primes would require unbounded steps.
    The Eisenstein-Jacobi integers a + bw, where a, b are integers and
w is a complex cube root of unity, w2 + w + 1 = 0, also enjoy unique
56                                    Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

factorization. The primes again form a pattern (Figure 5), this time with
hexagonal symmetry, because there are six units, ±1, ±w, ±w 2 . The prime
2 and those of shape 6k - 1 (5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 41, ... , ) are still Eisenstein-
Jacobi primes, but 3 and those of shape 6k + 1 can be factored:

 3 = (1 - w)(1 - w2),       7 = (2 - w)(2 - w2),        13 = (3 - w)(3 - w2),

19 = (3-2w)(3-2w2),       31 = (5-w)(5-w 2),       37 = (4-3w)(4-3w 2), ....

    John Leech asks for long arithmetic progressions of Gaussian primes
and also of Eisenstein-Jacobi primes. He finds nine in Figure 4 and twelve
in Figure 5. He later found the arithmetic progression

              -8 - 13i, -3 - 8i, 2 - 3i, 7 + 2i, ... , 37 + 32i

of ten Gaussian primes, the last three of which are outside Figure 4.

A17 Formulas for primes.
Perhaps the philosopher's stone of number theory is a formula for Pn, or for
7r(x), or for a necessary and sufficient condition for primality. Wilsons the-
orem@Wilson's theorem, that (p - I)! == -1 (mod p), seems to be unique
(is Vantieghem's result, that P > 2 is prime if and only if n~:i(2d 1) ==-
P mod 2P - 1, equivalent to it?); but even that is useless for computa-
tion. C. P. Willans and C. P. Wormell used it to give formulas which use
only elementary functions, but which are too clumsy to print here. The
Mann-Shanks algorithm is another curiosity, of even less practical value.
Matiyasevich and other logicians have used Wilson's theorem and their so-
lution of Hilbert's tenth problem to produce polynomials the positive part
of whose range is exactly the set of primes.
    Three theorems of Boris Stechkin may be worth recording. They are
based on the function




     (1) n - 1 is prime just if S(n) = d(n), the number of divisors of n,
     (2) n ± 1 are twin primes just if S(n) + S(n + 1) = 2d(n).
     (3) P < q odd primes implies S(q)-S(q-l)+S(q-2)- ... -S(p+l) = O.
   The numerous papers on this topic vary widely in their sophistication
and in their aim. It seems desirable to distinguish between

     1. A formula for 7r(x) as a function of x.

     2. A formula for Pn as a function of n.

     3. A necessary and sufficient condition for n to be prime.

     4. A function that is prime for each member of its domain.

     5. A function (the positive part of) whose range consists only of primes,
        or consists of all of the primes.

     6. A function whose range contains a high density of primes.

     7. A formula for the largest prime divisor of n.

     8. A formula for the prime factors of n.

     9. A formula for the smallest prime greater than n.

 10. A formula for Pn+l in terms of PI, P2, ... , Pn·

 11. An algorithm for generating the primes.            And so on ....

    Examples of each can be found in the references. We have already
mentioned (in AI) Euler's famous formula n 2 + n + 41. In some sense this
is best possible, but quadratic expressions with positive discriminant can
yield even longer sequences of prime values (though some of them may be
negative). Gilbert Fung gives 47n 2 - 1701n + 10181, 0 ::::; n ::::; 42, ~ =
979373 and Russell Ruby 36n 2 - 810n + 2753, 0 ::::; n ::::; 44, ~ = 223 27213.
    The first 1000 values of Euler's formula include 581 primes. Edgar
Karst beats this with 598 values of 2n 2 - 199 and in a 91-01-01 letter,
Stephen Williams announces 602 prime values of 2n 2 -1000n - 2609. The
corresponding numbers among the first 10000 values are 4148, 4373 and
4151. However, what is significant is not the actual density over the first
so many values, which clearly has to tend to zero in all cases, but the
asymptotic density, which, if we believe Hardy & Littlewood (see AI),
is always cy'n/ In n, and the best that can be done is to make the value
of c as large as possible. Shanks has calculated c = 3.3197732 for Euler's
formula and c = 3.6319998 for a polynomial x 2 +x+27941 found by Beeger.
Fung & Williams (see reference at Al and the references they give) have
achieved c = 5.0870883 with the formula x 2 + x + 132874279528931.
    If ~ is the discriminant of the quadratic, then the Legendre symbol (see
F5) (~) takes the value 1 for very few of the small primes, p.
   Sierpinski observes that it follows from Fermat's theorem that if n is
prime, then n divides

                    1n - 1 + 2n - 1 + ... + (n - 1),,-1 + 1.

Is the converse true? Giuga conjectured so, and verified it for n ::::; 10 1000
and Bedocchi verified it to n ::::; 10 1700 . Giuga observed that a counterex-
ample would be a Carmichael number (AI2, AI3), that pin would imply
that (p - l)l(n - 1) and that

                                  2:---
                                    1
                                    p

                                  pin


must be an integer, so that n contains at least eight distinct prime factors.
An equivalent conjecture is that

                             nB n - 1 == -1 mod n

where the Bernoulli numbers Bk are the coefficients in the expansion of
x/(e X - 1) = I:k>O BkXk /k! (compare D2).
    For a good survey paper, see Bateman & Diamond.
    The Borweins & Girgensohn list ten open problems. The first is a state-
ment of Giuga's conjecture in the form: show that no integer exists which
is both a Giuga number and a Carmichael number, or, more generally, that
no Giuga sequence can be a Carmichael sequence. The last is the Bernoulli
60                                    Unsolved Problems in Number Theory


number conjecture, which they attribute to Takashi Agoh. Here, a Giuga
number is a composite number n all of whose prime divisors, p, satisfy
pl(~ -1). A Giuga sequence is a finite increasing sequence {nl,"" n m }
such that



A Carmichael sequence is the corresponding generalization of Carmich-
ael numbers (A13). The smallest Giuga number contains at least 12055
decimal digits. Borwein & Wong increase this to 13800 digits.
     Agoh shows that if n is a Giuga number, then a n - p ::::::: 1 mod p3 for
each p which divides n and each a not divisible by p. Also, if the Fermat
quotient is qp(a) = (a P- 1 - l)/p and the Giuga quotient is Gp(a, n) =
(a n - p - 1)/p3, then
                                         n-p
                    (p - l)Gp(a, n) : : : : - 2 - qp(a) mod p
                                              p

for such n, p and a.
    A century-and-a-half-old conjecture is that there is always a prime be-
tween x 2 and (x + 1)2. See Dickson's History, I, pp.435-436, and, for
references to Sylvester and Schur, Erdos's famous 1934 paper; also his
1955 paper. This is implied by the conjecture that there is a prime in
the interval (x,x + x 1 / 2 ]. An easier problem is to let P(x) denote the
largest prime factor of TIx<n<x+xl/2 n and show that P(x) > XC for as
large a value of e ::::: 1 as possible. The values c = ~~, ~, 0.66, 112 v'69 =
0.6922185 ... , 0.7, 0.71, 0.723, and 0.732 have been obtained by Ra-
machandra, Ramachandra again (and see Jutila), S. W. Graham, Jia Chao-
Hua, R. C. Baker, Jia again, Jia and Liu Hong-Quan independendently, and
by Baker & Harman.
    Gerry Myerson asks us to prove that there is a positive constant e such
that
                   #{n ::::: x : [(4/3t] is composite} > ex
and says that there are heuristic arguments supporting much sharper es-
timates for the numbers of primes and composites in an initial segment of
the sequence [(4/3)n], but the statement above would already be far better
than any known result. He also asks us to prove that for every non-zero
real a there is a positive integer n (and hence infinitely many) such that
[lOna] is composite. Equivalently, show that there is no infinite sequence
of primes, each obtained from the previous by tacking a single (decimal)
digit on at the end. He says that the analogous result has been proved for
bases 2 through 6.

AlB The Erdos-Selfridge classification of
  .
prImes.
Erdos & Selfridge classify the primes as follows: p is in class 1 if the only
prime divisors of p + 1 are 2 or 3; and p is in class r if every prime factor of
p + 1 is in some class ~ r - 1, with equality for at least one prime factor.
For example:

class 1:   2 3 5 7 11 17 23 31 47 53 71 107 127 191 431 647 863 971

class 8:  49681 ...

    It's easy to prove that the number of primes in class r, not exceeding n,
is o(n£ for every E > 0 and all r. Prove that there are infinitely many primes
in each class. If p~r) denotes the least prime in class r, so that p~l) = 2,
p~2) = 13, pP) = 37, p~4) = 73 and p~5) = 1021, then Erdos thought that
(p~r))l/r --+ 00, while Selfridge thought it quite likely to be bounded.
    A similar classification arises if p + 1 is replaced by p - 1:
class 1:   2 3 5 7 13 17 19 37 73 97 109 163 193 433 487 577 769 1153 ...

for which similar answers are to be expected. Are corresponding classes
equally dense? There is a connexion with Cunningham chains (A7).

A19 Values of n making n - 2k prime. Odd
numbers not of the form ±pa ± 2b.
Erdos conjectures that 4, 7, 15, 21, 45, 75 and 105 are the only values of
n for which n - 2k is prime for all k such that 2 ::; 2k < n. Mientka &
Weitzenkamp have verified this for n < 244 and Uchiyama & Yorinaga have
extended this to 277. Vaughan has proved that there are not too many such
numbers, less than xexp{ -(lnx)C} of them less than x, but he was unable
to show that there were less than Xl-E.
    Erdos also conjectures that for infinitely many n, all the integers n - 2k ,
1::; 2k < n are squarefree (see also F13).
    If we denote by A( x) the number of n ::; x for which all n - 2k are prime,
2 :S 2k < n, then Hooley showed that the extended Riemann hypothesis
implies that A(x) = O(XC) with an explicit e < 1, and Narkiewicz improved
this to e < ~.
    Cohen & Selfridge ask for the least positive odd number not of the form
±pa ± 2b , where p is prime, a 2 0, b 2 1 and any choice of signs may be
made. They observe that the number is greater than 218 , but at most

   Sun Zhi-Wei proved that if

 x=47867742232066880047611079mod66483034025018711639862527490

then it is not of the form ±pa ± qb with p, q prime.
    Crocker proved that there are infinitely many odd integers not of the
form 2k + 2l + p, where p is prime. Erdos suggests that there may be ex
of them less than x, but can> x E be proved? Can we show that covering
congruences (F13) do not help here? I.e., does p+2 u +2 v (or p+2 u +2 v +2 W )
meet every arithmetic progression? More generally, Erdos asks if, for each
r, there are infinitely many odd integers not the sum of a prime and r or
fewer powers of 2. Is their density positive? Do they contain an infinite
arithmetic progression? In the opposite direction, Gallagher has proved
that for every E > 0 there is a sufficiently large r so that the lower density
of sums of primes with r powers of 2 is greater than 1 - E.
    Erdos also asks if there is an odd integer not of the form 2k + s where
s is squarefree. Jud McCranie searched for such numbers but found none
below 1.4 . 109 .
    Let f (n) be the number of representations of n as a sum 2k + p, and let
{ai} be the sequence of values of n for which f (n) > O. Does the density
of {ad exist? Erdos showed that f(n) > clnln n infinitely often, but could
not decide if f(n) = o(ln n). He conjectures that limsup(ai+1 - ai) = 00.
This would follow if there are covering systems with arbitrarily large least
moduli.

    Vassilev-Missana showed that there are infinitely many primes p such
that p + 2k is composite for all positive k and infinitely many such that
Ip - 2kl is so. Is there a prime p such that both are true? This is answered
positively by Sun Zhi-Wei. Briidern & Perelli show, assuming the general-
ized Riemann hypothesis, that the number of integers not exceeding x that
are not representable as a sum of a prime and a k-th power is« Xl-l/25k+€.
    Carl Pomerance notes that for n = 210, n - p is prime for all p, n/2 <
p < n, and asked if there is any other such n. With help from Deshouillers,
Granville & Narkiewicz he later answered this negatively.
    Hardy & Littlewood conjectured in 1923 that every sufficiently large
integer is either a square or the sum of a prime and a square. Davenport
& Heilbronn proved this in 1937 for almost all positive integers. If E(X) is
the number of not so expressible numbers less than X, then Wang showed
that E(X) « XO. 99 , and Li improved the exponent to 0.982.

A20 Symmetric and asymmetric primes.
Given a pair of odd primes p, q, let the number of lattice points (m, n) in
the rectangle 0 < m < pj2, 0 < n, qj2 and below the diagonal through
(0,0) be denoted by S(q,p). Then the number above the diagonal is
S(p, q), (_l)S(q,p) = (~), the Legendre symbol (see F5) and the iden-
tity S(p, q) + S(q,p) = *(p-l)(q-l) is related to the law of quadratic
reciprocity. Fletcher, Lindgren & Pomerance call a pair (p, q) such that
S(p, q) = S(q,p) symmetric, and show that a pair is symmetric just if
\p - q\ = (p - 1, q- 1). They call a member of a symmetric pair a sym-
metric prime and show that the number of them less than x is at most
xj(lnx)l.027. They conjecture that this number is xj(lnx)u+o(1), where
(]" = 2 - (1+lnln2)jln2 ~ 1.08607.

metric primes, J. Number Theory, 58(1996) 89-99; MR 97c:11007.
B. Divisibility


We will denote by d(n) the number of positive divisors of n, by a(n) the
sum of those divisors, and by ak(n) the sum of their kth powers, so that
ao(n) = d(n) and aI(n) = a(n). We use s(n) for the sum of the aliquot
parts of n, i.e., the positive divisors of n other than n itself, so that
s(n) = a(n) - n. The number of distinct prime factors of n will be denoted
by w(n) and the total number, counting repetitions, by!1(n).
   Iteration of various arithmetic functions will be denoted, for example,
by sk(n), which is defined by sO(n) = nand sk+I(n) = s(sk(n)) for k ~ o.
   We use the notation din to mean that d divides n, and e f n to mean
that e does not divide n. The notation pk II n is used to imply that pk I n but
pk+I f n. By [m, n) we will mean the consecutive integers m, m + 1, ... ,n.


B 1 Perfect numbers.
A perfect number is such that n = s(n). Euclid knew that 2P - I (2 P - 1)
was perfect if 2P - 1 is prime. For example, 6, 28, 496, ... ; see the list
of Mersenne primes in A3. Euler showed that these were the only even
perfect numbers.
    The existence or otherwise of odd perfect numbers is one of the more
notorious unsolved problems of number theory. Euler showed that they
have shape pam 2 where p is prime and p == 0: == 1 (mod 4). Touchard
showed that they were of shape 12m + 1 or 36m + 9.
    The lower bound for an odd perfect number has now been pushed to
10300 by Brent, Cohen & te Riele. Brandstein has shown that the largest
prime factor is > 500000 and Hagis that the second largest is > 1000.
Cohen has shown that it contains a component (prime power divisor) >
1020, and Sayers that there are at least 29 prime factors (not necessarily
distinct). Iannucci & Sorli improve this to !1(n) ~ 37.
    Pomerance has shown that an odd perfect number with at most k dis-
tinct factors is less than


but Heath-Brown has much improved this by showing that if n is an odd

                                                                            71
72                                    Unsolved Problems in Number Theory


number with a(n) = an, then n < (4d)4k, where d is the denominator
of a and k is the number of distinct prime factors of n. In particular, if
nk is an odd perfect number with k distinct prime factors, then n < 44k.
Roger Cook further improves this to nk < C 4k where C = 3512/511 ~ 3.006
and, for k = 8, to ng < D4 8 with D = 216 / 15 ~ 2.094 if 195 I ng or
D = 1951/ 7 ~ 2.123 otherwise. A recent claim by Nielsen is that nk < 24k.
    Starni has shown that if n = pC< M2 is an odd perfect number with p
prime, p ..1 M, p == a == 1 mod 4, a + 2 prime, (a + 2) ..1 (p - 1), then
M2 == 0 mod a + 2.
    Iannucci has shown that the second largest prime divisor of an odd
perfect number exceeds 104, that the third largest exceeds 102, and (with
Sorli) that there are at least 37 not necessarily distinct prime factors.
    John Leech asks for examples of spoof odd perfect numbers, like Des-
cartes's


which is perfect if you pretend that 22021 is prime.
    Greg Martin offers the following 'proof' that 4680 is perfect. Write 4680
as 23 .32 . (-5)· (-13). Then a(4680) =
   (1 + 2 + 22 + 23)(1 + 3 + 32)(1 + (-5))(1 + (-13)) = 9360 = 2·4680.
He asks: if you allow a( _pn) = 2::7=0 ( -p)j, are there others? Dennis Eich-
horn and Peter Montgomery found -84 = 22(3)( -7) and -120 = 23(3)( -5)
and noted that a((-2)5(3)(7)) = (_2)5(3)(7). Martin also defines a(pT) =
pT _ pT-1 +pT-2 _ ... + (-IY, and asks about a-(k)-perfect numbers. For
k = 2 there are 2, 12, 40, 252, 880, 10880, 75852. For k = 3 there are at
least 40, including 30240 and 210 34 54 11 . 132 . 31 ·61 . 157· 521 . 683.

B2 Almost perfect, quasi-perfect,
pseudoperfect, harmonic, weird, multiperfect
and hyperperfect numbers.
Perhaps because they were frustrated by their failure to disprove the exis-
tence of odd perfect numbers, numerous authors have defined a number of
closely related concepts and produced a raft of problems, many of which
seem no more tractable than the original.
     For a perfect number, a(n) = 2n. If a(n) < 2n, n is called deficient.
A problem in Abacus was to prove sum of divisors that every number n > 3
is the sum of two deficient numbers, or to find a number that was not. If
a(n) > 2n, then n is called abundant. If a(n) = 2n-1, n has been called
almost perfect. Powers of 2 are almost perfect; it is not known if any
other numbers are. If a(n) = 2n + 1, n has been called quasi-perfect.
Quasi-perfect numbers must be odd squares, but no one knows if there are
any. Masao Kishore shows that n > 1030 and that wen) ;::: 6. Hagis &
Cohen have improved these results to n > 1035 and wen) ~ 7. Cattaneo
                                               t
originally claimed to have proved that 3 n, but Sierpinski and others
have observed that his proof is fallacious. Kravitz, in a letter, makes a
more general conjecture, that there are no numbers whose abundance,
a(n) - 2n, is an odd square. In this connexion Graeme Cohen writes that
it is interesting that
                         a(223 252) = 3(223252) + 112
and that if a(n) = 2n+k2 with n -L k, then wen) ;::: 4 and n > 1020 . He has
also shown that if k < 1010 then wen) ;::: 6, and that if k < 44366047 then
n is primitive abundant (see below). Later, relaxing the condition n -L k,
he finds the solution
                   n = 2 . 32 . 2388972,   k = 32 . 23 . 1999
and five solutions n = 22 . 72 . p2, with
 p = 53            277        541            153941             358276277
 k = 7· 29      5 . 7 . 23 5 . 7 . 43   5 . 7 . 103 . 113 5 . 7 . 227 . 229 . 521
   He verifies that the first of these last five is the smallest integer with
odd square abundance. Sidney Kravitz has since sent two more solutions,
                    n = 23 . 32 . 16572,   k = 3 . 11 . 359,

       n=24 ·31 2 ·79922201791288932 ,       k=44498798693247589.
In the latter, 31 divides k. Erdos asks for a characterization of the large
numbers for which la(n) - 2nl < C for some constant C. For example,
n = 2m : for other infinite families, see Ml}kowski's two papers.
    Wall, Crews & Johnson showed that the density of abundant numbers
lies between 0.2441 and 0.2909. In an 83-08-17 letter Wall claimed to have
narrowed these bounds to 0.24750 and 0.24893. Erdos asks if the density
is irrational.
    Paul Zimmerman reports that Marc DeIeglise has improved the bounds
for the density of abundant numbers to 0.2477 ± 0.0003.
http://www.mathsoft.com/asolve/constant/abund/abund.html
     Sandor has shown that, for sufficiently large n, there is a deficient num-
ber between nand n + (In n)2 .
     Sierpinski called a number pseudoperfect if it was the sum of some
of its divisors; e.g., 20 = 1 + 4 + 5 + 10. Erdos has shown that their
density exists and says that presumably there are integers n which are not
pseudoperfect, but for which n = ab with a abundant and b having many
prime factors: can b in fact have many factors < a?
     For n ;::: 3 Abbott lets l = l(n) be the least integer for which there are
n integers 1 :::; al < a2 < ... < an = l such that ails = I: ai for each i (so
that sis pseudoperfect). He can show that l(n) > nCllnlnn for some Cl > 0
and all n ;::: 3 and that l(n) < nC21nlnn for some C2 > 0 and infinitely many
n.
     Call a number primitive abundant if it is abundant, but all its
proper divisors are deficient, and primitive pseudoperfect if it is pseu-
doperfect, but none of its proper divisors are. If the harmonic mean,
H(n) = nd(n)/a(n), of all the positive divisors of n is an integer, Pomer-
ance called n a harmonic number. A. & E. Zachariou called these "Ore
numbers" and they called primitive pseudoperfect numbers "irreducible
semiperfect". They note that every multiple of a pseudoperfect number is
pseudoperfect and that the pseudoperfect numbers and the harmonic num-
bers both include the perfect numbers as a proper subset. The last result
is due to Ore. All numbers 2mp with m ;::: 1 and p a prime between 2m and
2m +1 are primitive pseudoperfect, but there are such numbers not of this
form, e.g., 770. There are infinitely many primitive pseudoperfect numbers
that are not harmonic numbers. The smallest odd primitive pseudoperfect
number is 945. Erdos showed that the number of odd primitive pseudop-
erfect numbers is infinite. He also showed that, for sufficiently large n, the
number of primitive abundant numbers less than n was bounded above and
below by functions of the form n exp( -cv!1n n In In n). Ivic showed that the
constants could be taken to be 12-! - E and 6! + E and Avidon improved
these to 1 - E and 2! + E.
     Garda extended the list of harmonic numbers to include all 45 which
76                                    Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

are < 107 , and he found more than 200 larger ones. The least one, apart
from 1 and the perfect numbers, is 140. Are any of them squares, apart
from I? Are there infinitely many of them? If so, find upper and lower
bounds on the number of them that are < x. Kanold has shown that their
density is zero, and Pomerance that a harmonic number of the form paqb
(p and q primes) is an even perfect number. If n = paqbrc is harmonic, is
it even?
    Which values does the harmonic mean take? The specific questions
that we asked earlier have been answered. Ore's own conjecture, that
every harmonic number > 1 is even, implies that there are no odd perfect
numbers!
    Cohen listed all 52 harmonic numbers of the form 2a m, where m is odd
and squarefree and 1 ::::; a ::::; 11; 45 of them have a = 8. He also shows that
there are just 13 harmonic numbers n with H(n) = nd(n)ja(n) ::::; 13:
     H(n) = 1 2 3 5 6 5 8         9    11   10    7    13      13

    Cohen & Sorli defined a harmonic seed to be a harmonic number which
has no smaller proper unitary divisor which is harmonic. It is not known if
there are infinitely many harmonic seeds, not even that there are infinitely
many harmonic numbers.
    Goto & Shibata found all harmonic numbers with mean up to 300.
They ask several questions. Is there a nontrivial odd harmonic number?
Are there infinitely many harmonic seeds with just three distinct prime
factors? If not, find them all. Does every harmonic number have a unique
harmonic seed? Is there a powerful (see B16) harmonic number? Is there
a deficient harmonic number?
    A positive integer n is an arithmetic number if the arithmetic mean,
A(n) = a(n)jd(n), of its positive divisors is an integer. Goto & Shibata
show that a harmonic number is also arithmetic just if H(n), the harmonic
mean of the divisors, divides n. Examples are 140, 270, 672. They note
that in all examples with H(n) = 3p < 300, n is arithmetic, and ask if this
is true for all prime values of p.
    Bateman, Erdos, Pomerance & Straus show that the set of arithmetic
numbers has density 1, that the set for which a(n)jd(n)2 is an integer has
density ~, and that the number of rationals r ::::; x of the form a(n)jd(n)
is o(x). They ask for an asymptotic formula for




where the sum is taken over those n ::::; x for which d(n) does not divide a(n).
They also note that the integers n for which d( n) divides s( n) = a( n) - n,
have zero density, because for almost all n, d( n) and a( n) are divisIble by
a high power of 2, while n is divisible only by a low power of 2.

   David Wilson, in a 98-08-27 email, conjectured that a(n) ::/= kn+5. Dan

   Benkoski has called a number weird if it is abundant but not pseudo-
perfect. For example, 70 is not the sum of any subset of

                     1 + 2 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 14 + 35 = 74

There are 24 primitive weird numbers less than a million: 70, 836, 4030,
5830, 7192, .... Nonprimitive weird numbers include 70p with p prime and
p > a(70) = 144; 836p with p = 421, 487, 491, or p prime and 2: 557; also
7192·31. Some large weird numbers were found by Kravitz, and Benkoski
& Erdos showed that their density is positive. Here the open questions are:
are there infinitely many primitive abundant numbers which are weird? Is
every odd abundant number pseudoperfect (Le., not weird)? Can a(n)jn
be arbitrarily large for weird n? Benkoski & Erdos conjecture "no" in
answer to the last question and Erdos offers $10 and $25 respectively for
solutions to the last two questions.
    He also asks if there are extra-weird numbers n for which a(n) > 3n,
but n is not the sum of distinct divisors of n in two ways without repeti-
tions. For example, 180 does not qualify, because although a(180) = 546,
180=30+60+90 and is the sum of all its other divisors except 6.
    One definition of a practical number, m, is for every n, 1::; n ::; a(m)
to be expressible as the sum of distinct divisors of m. E.g., 6 is practical,
since 4=1+3, 5=2+3, 7=1+6, 8=2+6, 9=3+6, 10=1+3+6, 11=2+3+6,
12=1+2+3+6. Erdos showed in 1950 that the practical numbers have zero
asymptotic density. It is known that if P(x) is the number of practical
numbers less than x, then

                  xexp(-0:(lnlnx)2)« P(x)« xj(lnx)t3

for some positive constants 0: and (3. The lower bound is due to Margen-
stein and the upper bound to Hausman & Shapiro. Melfi has shown that
every even number is the sum of two practical numbers and that there are
infinitely many practical numbers m such that m ± 2 are also practical.

    Numbers have been called multiply perfect, multiperfect or k-fold
perfect if a(n) = kn with k an integer. For example, ordinary perfect
numbers are 2-fold perfect and 120 is 3-fold perfect. Dickson's History
records a long interest in such numbers. Lehmer has remarked that if n is
odd, then n is perfect just if 2n is triperfect.
   Selfridge and others have observed that there are just six known 3-
perfect numbers and they come from 2h -1 for h = 4,6,9, 10, 14, 15. For
example, the third one is illustrated by

     a(28 ·7·73·37· 19·5) = (29 - 1)(23 )(37.2)(19.2)(5.2 2)(2.3).

It appears that there may be a similar explanation for the 36 known 4-
perfect numbers, the last of which was published by Poulet as long ago as
1929.
    For many years the largest known value of k was 8, for which Alan
L. Brown gave three examples and Franqui & Garda two others.
    In late 1992 and early 1993, half a dozen examples with k = 9 had
already been found by Fred Helenius. The smallest is

    On 97-05-13 Ron Sorli found a lO-fold perfect number, and George
Woltman found an 11-fold one on 2001-03-13.
    In 1992 we knew of 700 k-perfect numbers with k ~ 3. In January,
1993, this number leapt to about 1150 from the discoveries of Fred Helenius
which included 114 7-perfect, 327 8-perfect and two 9-perfect numbers. He
continued to find dozens of new ones each month, so that it is even less
possible to keep this section of the book up-to-date than it is elsewhere; in
March 1993 the total neared 1300; a postscript of a 93-09-08 letter from
Schroeppel gave 1526; by the time he mailed it next day it was 1605. At
the end of 2002, there were 8! known multiperfect numbers. These include
1 (for k = 1) and 39 Mersenne primes (k = 2). The numbers of others are
      k =    3 4         5     6       7        8       9       10 11 Total

    Can k be as large as we wish? Erdos conjectured that k = o(ln In n).
It has even been suggested that there may be only finitely many k-perfect
numbers for each k ~ 3. The first five numbers in the above table may well
be complete.
    If n is an odd triperfect number, then McDaniel, Cohen, Kishore,
Bugulov, Kishore, Cohen & Hagis, Reidlinger, and Kishore have respec-
tively shown that w(n) ~ 9, 9, 10, 11, 11, 11, 12, and 12; while Beck

& Najar, Alexander, and Cohen & Hagis have respectively shown that
n > 1050 , 1060 , 1070 . Cohen & Hagis have shown that the largest prime
factor of n is at least 100129 and that the second largest is at least 1009.
    Shigeru Nakamura writes that Bugulov showed, in 1966, that odd k-
perfect numbers contain at least w distinct prime factors, where (k,w) =
(3,11), (4,21), (5,54) [incorrectly stated in MR 37 #5139 & rNT A32-96].
Nakamura claims to prove that for an even k-perfect number,

       w > max{k3 /81 +   i, k5 /2500 + 2.9, k iO /(14.108 ) + 2.9999}
and for an odd k-perfect number,

         w > max{k 5 /60 +   i;, k5 /50 - 20.8, 737k IO /109 + 11.5}.
These improve the results of Cohen & Hendy and of Reidlinger; he also
gives the improvements (k,w) = (4,23), (5,56), (6,142), (7,373) to those of
Bugulov.
    Minoli & Bear say that n is k-hyperperfect if n = 1 + k L: d i , where
the summation is taken over all proper divisors, 1 < di < n, so that
ka(n) = (k+l)n+k-l. For example, 21, 2133 and 19521 are 2-hyperperfect
and 325 is 3-hyperperfect. They conjecture that there are k-hyperperfect
numbers for every k.
    Cohen & te Riele call numbers (m, k)-perfect if amen) = kn; e.g.,
perfect numbers are (1,2)-perfect, multiperfect numbers are (1, k)-perfect;
(2, 2)-perfect numbers have been called superperfect and (2, k )-perfect num-
bers multiply superperfect. They tabulate all (m, k)-perfect numbers n for
(m,n) = (2,< 109 ), (3,< 2.108 ), (4,< 108 ) and prove that the equa-
tion a 2(2n) = 2a 2(n) has infinitely many solutions. They ask: for any
fixed m, are there infinitely many (m, k)-perfect numbers? and: is every n
(m, k)-perfect for some m? For n E [1,400] they list the least such m.
    Eswarathasan & Levine define a(n)/b(n) = L:i = I n l/i with a(n) ..1
ben) and a(O) = 0, and for p prime consider the sets J(p) = {n ~ 0 : pi
a(n)} and I(p) = {n ~ 0 : p does not divide ben)}. Then J(2) = {O},
J(3) = {O, 2, 7, 22} and, for p ~ 5, J(p) ;;? O,p - l,p2 - p,p2 - 1; they give
necessary and sufficient conditions for equality and show that the primes
less than 200 which satisfy these conditions are 5, 13, 17, 23, 41, 67, 73,
79, 107, 113, 139, 149, 157, 179, 191, 193. [1(5) = {I, 2, 3, 4, ... } was
the subject of Putnam problem 1997 B3.] It is conjectured that there are
infinitely many such primes. In contrast

  J(7) = {O, 6,42,48, 295,299, 337, 341, 2096, 2390, 14675,16735, 102728},

but it is also conjectured that J(p) is always finite.
   Ron Graham asks if sen) = In/2J implies that n is 2 or a power of 3.
Luo Shi-Le & Le Mao-Hua have given a partial answer.

     Erdos lets f(n) be the smallest integer for which n = E7=1 di for some
k, where 1 = d 1     < d 2 < ... dl = f(n) is the increasing sequence of
divisors of f(n). Is f(n) = o(n)? Or is this true only for almost all n, with

     Erdos defined nk to be the smallest integer for which if you partition the
proper divisors of nk into k classes, nk will always be the sum of distinct
divisors from the same class. Clearly nl = 6, but he was not even able to
prove the existence of n2.

B3 Unitary perfect numbers.
If d divides nand d 1. njd, call d a unitary divisor of n. A number n
which is the sum of its unitary divisors, apart from n itself, is a unitary
perfect number. There are no odd unitary perfect numbers, and Sub-
barao conjectures that there are only a finite number of even ones. He,
Carlitz & Erdos each offer $10.00 for settling this question and Subbarao
offers 1O¢ for each new example. If n = 2a m, where m is odd and has r
distinct prime factors, then Subbarao and others have shown that, apart
from 2 . 3, 22 . 3 . 5, 2 . 32 . 5 and 26 • 3 . 5 . 7 . 13, there are no unitary perfect
numbers with a S; 10, or with r S; 6. S. W. Graham has shown that the
first and third are the only unitary perfect numbers of shape 2a m with m
odd and squarefree, and Jennifer DeBoer that the second is the only one
of shape 2a 32 m with m 1. 6 and squarefree.
B. Divisibility                                                               85

   Wall has found the unitary perfect number
              218 . 3 . 54 . 7· 11 . 13· 19·37· 79 . 109 . 157· 313
and shown that it is the fifth such. He can prove that any other unitary
perfect number has an odd component greater than 215 . Frey has shown
that if N = 2mp~1 ... p~r is unitary perfect with N ..l.. 3, then m > 144,
r> 144 and N > 1044     °.
    Peter Hagis investigates unitary multiperfect numbers: there are
no odd ones. Write (7* (n) for the sum of the unitary divisors of n. If
(7*(n) = kn and n contains t distinct odd prime factors, then k = 4 or 6
implies n > lO llo , t ~ 51 and 249 1n; k ~ 8 implies n > 10663 and t ~ 247;
while k odd and k ~ 5 imply n > 10461 , t ~ 166 and 21661n.
    Sitaramaiah & Subbarao call a number unitary superperfect if it
satisfies the equation (7* (7ast (n)) = 2n. They find 22 such numbers below
108 .
    Cohen calls a divisor d of an integer n a 1-ary divisor of n if d..l.. njd,
and he calls d a k-ary divisor of n (for k > 1), and writes dlkn, if the
greatest common (k -1 )-ary divisor of d and n j d is 1 (written (d, n j d) k-1 =
1). In this notation din and d II n are written dlon and dl 1n. He also
calls pX an infinitary divisor of pY(y > 0) if pXly_1pY. This gives rise
to infinitary analogs of earlier concepts. Write (7oo(n) for the sum of the
infinitary divisors of n. He found 14 infinitary perfect numbers, i.e., with
(7oo(n) = kn and k = 2; 13 numbers with k = 3; 7 with k = 4; and two
with k = 5. There are no odd ones, and he conjectures that there are no
infinitary multiperfect numbers not divisible by 3.
    Note that Suryanarayana (who also uses the term 'k-ary divisor') and
Alladi give different generalizations of unitary divisors.

B4 Amicable numbers.
Unequal numbers m, n are called amicable if each is the sum of the aliquot
parts of the other, i.e., u(m) = u(n) = m + n. Several thousand (in 2003,
'million') such pairs are known. The smaller member, 220, of the smallest
pair, occurs in Genesis, xxxii, 14, and intrigued the Greeks and Arabs and
many others since. For their history see the articles of Lee & Madachy. The
Genesis reference, from the King James Bible, is achieved by amalgamating
200 females and 20 males. Aviezri Fraenkel writes that in his Pentateuch,
they occur at xxxii, 15, and gives the more convincing occurrences of 220
in Ezra viii, 20 and in 1 Chronicles xv, 6; and of 284 in Nehemiah xi, 18.
He notes that the three places are amicably related: all are connected to
B. Divisibility                                                             87

the tribe of Levi, whose name derives from the wish of Levi's mother to be
amicably related to his father (Genesis xxix, 34).
    It is not known if there are infinitely many, but it is believed that there
are. In fact Erdos conjectured that the number, A(x), of such pairs with
m < n < x is at least xl-€. He improved a result of Kanold to show that
A(x) = o(x) and his method can be used to obtain A(x) ~ cx/lnlnlnx.
Pomerance obtained the further improvement
                    A(x) ~ xexp{-c(lnlnlnxlnlnlnlnx)1/2}.
Erdos conjectured that A(x) = o(x/(lnx)k) for every k whereupon Pomer-
ance proved the stronger result
                           A(x) ~ xexp{ -(lnx)1/3}.
This implies that the sum of the reciprocals of the amicable numbers is
finite, a fact not earlier known. He also notes that his proof can be modified
to give the slightly stronger result
                       A(x) « x exp{ -c(lnx Inlnx)1/3}.
    Herman te Riele has found all 1427 amicable pairs whose lesser members
are less than 1010. He remarks that the quantity A(x)(lnx)3 /X 1 / 2 "remains
very close to 174.6", but I suspect that a much more powerful telescope
would require the exponent 1/2 to be increased much nearer to 1. Moews
& Moews have continued the complete search to beyond 2 . 1011.
    Some large amicable pairs, with 32, 40, 81 and 152 decimal digits,
discovered by te Riele, are mentioned by Kaplansky under "Mathemat-
ics" in the 1975 Encyclopedia Britannica Yearbook. The largest previously
known had 25 decimal digits. More recently te Riele has constructed, from
a "mother" list of 92 known amicable pairs, more than 2000 new pairs of
sizes up to 38 decimal digits, and five pairs with from 239 to 282 digits. The
largest amicable pair known in mid-1993 had 1041 decimal digits; it was
found in July 1988 by Holger Wiethaus, a student at Dortmund. On 97-10-
04 Mariano Garcia found a pair each of whose members has 4829 digits, and
soon raised this to 5577. These exceeded the pair with 3766 digits found by
Frank Zweers the previous August. On 2003-06-06 Paul Jobling announced
the 8684-digit pair (abp145 q1 , aqp145q2) where a = 33 .52 ·19·31· 757·3329,
b = 1511 . 72350721629·2077116867246979,
p=454299173560665115110417717001,
q=232896955674233835885324043020784378057919,
ql = 232896955674688135058884708135894795774920· p145 - 1
and q2 = 227224727234251073302682233800· p145 - 1.
   Elvin J. Lee has given half a dozen rules for amicable pairs of type
(2npq,2nrs) where p, q, r, s are primes of appropriate shape. E.g.,

p = 3·2 n - 1 _1,     q = 35·2n +l-29,   r = 7·2 n - 1 -1,   s = 15·2 n+l-13,
88                                         Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

but the simultaneous discovery of four such primes is a rare event.
    Borho, Hoffman & te Riele have made considerable advances, both with
proliferation of generalized Thabit rules, and with actual computation. Of
the 1427 amicable pairs mentioned above, all but 17 have m+n == 0 mod 9.
The smallest exception is Poulet's pair

                                24 . 331 . { 19· 6619
                                             199·661

with m + n == 5 mod 9: te Riele gives the first examples

        24 . { 192 . 103 . 1627                 2     { 132 . 37 . 43 . 139
               3847 ·16763             and     2· 19 . 41 . 151 . 6709

with m,n even, m + n == 3 mod 9.
    It is not known if an amicable pair exists with m and n of opposite
parity, or with m ..1 n. Bratley & McKay conjectured that both members
of all odd amicable pairs are divisible by 3, but Battiato & Borho produced
15 counterexamples with from 36 to 73 decimal digits. In an 87-05-15 letter
te Riele announced a 33-digit specimen (misquoted in UPINT2)

      5.72 .11 2 .13.17.193 .23.37.181 { 101· 8693 ·19479382229
                                         365147·47307071129

Is this the smallest such pair? Is there an odd amicable pair with one
member, but not both, divisible by 3? No pair has been discovered with
different smallest prime factors.
    Yasutoshi Kohmoto found pairs with each member coprime to 30, for
example
 72 . 11 . 132 • 174 . 193 . 23 . 292 • 31 . 37 . 43 . 59 . 61 . 67 . 83 . 97 . 139 . 173 x

           or     274619514946479128750633094342593247910863599
     An old conjecture of Charles Wall is that odd amicable pairs must be
incongruent modulo 4.
     On p. 169 of Mathematical Magic Show, Vintage Books, 1978, Martin
Gardner makes a conjecture about the digital roots of amicable numbers.
Lee confirms this in part by showing that if (2 n pqr,2 n stu) is an amicable
pair whose sum is not divisible by 9, then each number is congruent to 7,
modulo 9.
    Unitary amicable numbers, that is, pairs (m, n) such that the sum of
the unitary divisors of each is equal to their sum, m + n, have been studied
by Peter Hagis and by Mariano Garcia. If an amicable pair is squarefree,
B. Divisibility                                                               89

then it is also a unitary amicable pair. Hagis found 76 such pairs and
32 others which are not square free. The smallest is (114,126). He asks if
there are infinitely many such pairs. In particular, are there infinitely many
"twin" pairs, such as (197340,286500) and (241110,242730) whose sums are
both 483840, a very smooth number, as is the sum, 211 .3 5 .5 4 .7.11 of
the other twin pairs that he lists. He conjectures that no relatively prime
pair exists, and asks for an example of an odd non-squarefree pair (which
would not, therefore, be amicable).
    Yasutoshi Kohmoto, on 2004-01-30, announced the 317-digit pair

   Cohen & te Riele call (a, b) a ¢-amicable pair with multiplier k if
¢(a) = ¢(b) = (a + b)jk for some integer k ~ 1, where ¢ is Euler's totient
function (see B36). They computed all such pairs with larger member
S 109 and found 812 pairs whose gcd is squarefree.

B5 Quasi-amicable or betrothed numbers.
Garda has called a pair of numbers (m, n), m < n, quasi-amicable if

                          O"(m) = O"(n) = m + n + l.

 For example, (48,75), (140,195), (1575,1648), (1050,1925) and (2024,2295).

of the other (i.e., omitting 1 as well as the number itself) has much more
appropriately named them betrothed numbers.

   Ml}kowski gave examples of betrothed numbers and also of amicable
triples
                       a-(a) = a-(b) = a-(c) = a + b + c,
   e.g., 2 3 5.11, 2 327, 223271. Similarly, in a 92-07-20 letter, Yasutoshi

Kohmoto calls the set {a, b, c, d} quadri-amicable if
                a-(a) = a-(b) = a-(c) = a-(d) = a + b + c + d.

with a perfect number 2P - 1 Mp, Mp = 2P - 1 being a Mersenne prime (see
A3) with p > 3.
    Hagis & Lord have found all 46 pairs of betrothed numbers with m <
107 . All of them are of opposite parity. No pairs are known with m, n
having the same parity. If there are such, then m > 1010. If m ..l n, then
mn contains at least four distinct prime factors, and if mn is odd, then mn
contains at least 21 distinct prime factors.
    Beck & Najar call such pairs reduced amicable pairs, and call numbers
m, n such that
                         a-(m) = a-(n) = m + n - 1
augmented amicable pairs. They found 11 augmented amicable pairs. They
found no reduced or augmented unitary amicable or sociable numbers (see
BS) with n < 105 .

B6 Aliquot sequences.
Since some numbers are abundant and some deficient, it is natural to ask
what happens when you iterate the function s(n) = a-(n) - n and produce
B. Divisibility                                                                                 93


an aliquot sequence, {8 k(n)}, k = 0, 1, 2, ... . Catalan and Dick-
son conjectured that all such sequences were bounded, but we now have
heuristic arguments and experimental evidence that some sequences, per-
haps almost all of those with n even, go to infinity. The smallest n for
which there was ever doubt was 138, but D. H. Lehmer eventually showed
that after reaching a maximum

                8 117 (138) =    179931895322 = 2 . 61 ·929 . 1587569

the sequence terminated at 8 177 (138) = 1. The next value for which there
continues to be real doubt is 276. A good deal of computation by Lehmer,
subsequently assisted by Godwin, Selfridge, Wunderlich and others, pushed
the calculation as far as 8 469 (276), which was quoted in the first edition.
Thomas Struppeck factored this term and computed two more iterates.
Andy Guy wrote a PARI program which started from scratch and overnight
verified all the earlier calculations and reached 8 487 (276).
    The first few sequences whose fate was unknown are the "Lehmer six"
starting from 276, 552, 564, 660, 840 and 966. Our program found that the
840 sequence hit the prime 8 746 (840) = 601 and established a new record

 8 287 (840) = 3463982260143725017429794136098072146586526240388


     =22 .64970467217.6237379309797547.2136965558478112990003
for the maximum of a terminating sequence. This has since been beaten
by Mitchell Dickerman who found that the 1248 sequence has length 1075
after reaching a maximum 8 583 (1248) =
      1231636691923602991963829388638861714770651073 275257065104 = 24p
of 58 digits, and by Paul Zimmerman who found that the 446580 sequence
terminates at step 4736 with the prime 601.
     Godwin investigated the fourteen main sequences starting between 1000
and 2000 whose outcome was unknown and discovered that the sequence
1848 terminated. We have found that those for 2580, 2850, 4488, 4830,
6792, 7752, 8862 and 9540 also terminate.
     Wieb Bosma showed that the 3556 sequence teminated. Benito &
Verona have shown that the 4170, 7080 and 8262 sequences each termi-
nate, the first of which had a (then) record maximum of 84 decimal digits:
8 289 (4170) =

   Wolfgang Creyaufmiiller has made extensive calculations, the results of
which may be seen at

   Comparatively few have terminated, and many open-ended sequences
have appeared. His limits of computation generally exceed 1080 • The
current numbers of open-ended sequences in the interval (( k -1) 105, k . 105)
is

which support the Guy-Selfridge conjecture as opposed to that of Catalan-
Dickson. Creyaufmiiller's graphs are convincing even though 564 almost
bit the dust on one occasion. In March 2004, his page gave statistics for
the Lehmer five as:
               Sequence         276     552    564      660   966

    Much of the later calculation has been done by Paul Zimmermann.
Creyaufmiiller ceased calculating the 389508 sequence when it reached 101
digits at step 7135.
   H. W. Lenstra has proved that it is possible to construct arbitrarily
long monotonic increasing aliquot sequences. See the quadruple paper cited
under B41. The last of the following references has a bibliography of 60

B7 Aliquot cycles. Sociable numbers.
Aliquot cycles or sociable numbers. Poulet discovered two cycles of
numbers, showing that sk (n) can have the periods 5 and 28, in addition to
1 and 2. For k == 0, 1,2,3,4 mod 5, sk(12496) takes the values

       12496 = 24 . 11 . 71,   14288 = 24 . 19·47,     15472 = 24 ·967,

                    14536 = 23 . 23·79,   14264 = 23 . 1783.
For k == 0,1, ... ,27 mod 28, sk(14316) takes the values

    After a gap of over 50 years, and the advent of high-speed computing,
Henri Cohen discovered nine cycles of period 4, and Borho, David and Root
also discovered some. Recently Moews & Moews have made an exhaustive
search for such cycles with greatest member less than lOlO. There are
twenty-four: their smallest members are

   Moews & Moews give five larger 4-cycles, and, in a 90-09-01 letter,
another whose least member is:

                       26 • 79 . 1913 . 226691 . 207722852483

They also found an 8-cycle:

  Ren Yuanhua had already found three of the 4-cycles and Achim Flam-
menkamp had also found many of them, as well as a second 8-cycle:

   Moews & Moews have continued their exhaustive search to uncover all
cycles, of any length, whose member preceding the largest member is less
than 3.6 . 1010. There are three more 4-cycles, with least members

             15837081520,     17616303220,                  21669628904,
and a 6-cycle, all of whose members are odd:

B8 Unitary aliquot sequences.
The ideas of aliquot sequence and aliquot cycle can be adapted to the case
where only the unitary divisors are summed, leading to unitary aliquot
sequences and. We use a*(n) and s*(n) for the analogs of a(n) and s(n)
when just the unitary divisors are summed (compare B3).
    Are there unbounded unitary aliquot sequences? Here the balance is
more delicate than in the ordinary aliquot sequence case. The only se-
quences which deserve serious consideration are those involving odd mul-
tiples of 6, which is a unitary perfect number as well as an ordinary one.
Now the sequences tend to increase if 311n, but decrease when a higher
power of 3 is present, and it is a moot point as to which situation will
dominate. Once a term of a sequence is 6m, with m odd, then a* (6m) is
an even multiple of 6, making s*(6m) an odd multiple of 6 again, except
in the extremely rare case that m is 4 raised to an odd power.
    te Riele pursued all unitary aliquot sequences for n < 105 . The only one
which did not terminate or become periodic was 89610. Later calculations
showed that this reached a maximum,
       645856907610421353834 = 2.3 2 ·13 ·19·73·653·3047409443791

at its 568th term, and terminated at its 1129th.
    One can hardly expect typical behavior until the expected number of
prime factors is large. Since this number is In In n, such sequences are well
beyond computer range. Of 80 sequences examined near 10 12 , all have
terminated or become periodic. One sequence exceeded 1023.
    Unitary amicable pairs and unitary sociable numbers may occur rather
more frequently than their ordinary counterparts. Lal, Tiller & Summers
found cycles of periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14, 25, 39 and 65. Examples
of unitary amicable pairs are (56430,64530) and (1080150,1291050), while
(30,42,54) is a 3-cycle and

                         (1482,1878,1890,2142,2178)
98                                    Unsolved Problems in Number Theory


is a 5-cycle.
    Cohen (see B3 for definitions and a reference) finds 62 infinitary amica-
ble pairs with smaller member less than a million, eight infinitary aliquot
cycles of order 4 and three of order 6. The only other such cycle of order
less than 17 and least member less than a million is of order 11:
            448800, 696864, 1124448, 1651584, 3636096, 6608784,
                  5729136, 3736464, 2187696, 1572432, 895152.
    A type of aliquot sequence which can be unbounded has been suggested
by David Penney & Carl Pomerance and is based on Dedekind's function:
see B41. It was in fact the subject of Chapter 7 of te Riele's thesis.
    Erdos, looking for a number-theoretic function whose iterates might
be bounded, suggested defining w(n) = n E l/pfi where n = TIpfi, and
wk(n) = w(w k- 1 (n)). Note that w(n) ..L n. Can it be proved that wk(n),
k = 1, 2, ... , is bounded? Is I{w(n) : 1 ::; n::; x}1 = o(x)?
    Erdos & Selfridge called n a barrier for a number-theoretic function
f(m) if, for all m < n, m + f(m) ::; n. Euler's ¢-function (see B36) and
a(m) increase too fast to have barriers, but does w(m) have infinitely many
barriers? The numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 20, 24, 26, 28,
30, ... , are barriers for w(m). Does Q(m) have infinitely many barriers?
Selfridge observes that 99840 is the largest barrier for Q( m) that is < 105 •
Ml}kowski observes that n = 1 is a barrier for every function, and that 2
is a barrier for every function f(n) with f(l) = 1; in particular for d(m),
the number of divisors of m. The inequality

             max{d(n-1) +n -l,d(n - 2) +n - 2};::: n+2

holds for n ;::: 7, but not for n = 6. But d(n -1) + n -1;::: n + 1 for n ;::: 3,
so d( m) has no barriers ;::: 3. Does

                           max(m + d(m)) = n + 2
                           m<n

have infinitely many solutions? It is very doubtful. The first few are n = 5,
8, 10, 12, 24; Jud McCranie found no others below 1010.

B9 Superperfect numbers.
Suryanarayana defines superperfect numbers n by a 2 (n) = 2n, i.e.,
a( a( n)) = 2n. He and Kanold show that the even ones are just the numbers
2P - 1 where 2P - 1 is a Mersenne prime. Are there any odd superperfect
numbers? If so, Kanold shows that they are perfect squares, and Dandepat
and others that n or a(n) is divisible by at least three distinct primes.
     More generally, Bode defines m-superperfect numbers as numbers
n for which am (n) = 2n, and shows that for m ~ 3 there are no even
m-superperfect numbers. He also shows that for m = 2 there is no super-
perfect number < 1010. Hunsucker & Pomerance have raised this bound
to 7 x 1024 and have shown that if n is an odd super perfect number, then
na(n) has at least 5 distinct prime factors, and that the number of distinct
prime factors in n, together with the number of distinct prime factors in
a(n) is at least 7. These results are announced in the paper with Dandapat.
     If a 2 (n) = 2n+ 1, it would be consistent with earlier terminology to call
n quasi-superperfect. The Mersenne primes are such. Are there others?
Are there "almost superperfect numbers" for which a 2 (n) = 2n - 1 ?
     Erdos asks if (ak(n))l/k has a limit as k ~ 00. He conjectures that it
is infinite for each n > 1.
     Schinzel asks if lim inf a k (n) / n < 00 for each k, as n ~ 00, and observes
that it follows for k = 2 from a deep theorem of Renyi. Ml}kowski &
Schinzel give an elementary proof for k = 2 that the limit is 1. Helmut
Maier has used sieve methods to prove the result for k = 3.

     Sitaramaiah & Subbarao call a number unitary superperfect if it sat-
isfies the equation IJ* (IJ* (n)) = 2n. They note that the equation IJ* (IJ* (n)) =
2n + 1 has no solutions and that IJ* (IJ* (n)) = 2n - 1 has only n = 1
and 3. They list the unitary superperfect numbers less than 108 : 2, 9,

perfect numbers, of which only a finite number are odd. They also list the
solutions n = 10, 30, 288, 660, 720, 2146560 of 1J*(IJ*(n)) = kn for k = 3
and the solution n = 18 for k = 4.

BID Untouchable numbers.
Erdos has proved that there are infinitely many n such that s(x) = n has no
solution. Alanen calls such n untouchable. In fact Erdos showed that the
untouchable numbers have positive lower density. Here are the untouchable
numbers less than 1000:

In view of the plausibility of the Goldbach conjecture (Cl), it seems likely
that 5 is the only odd untouchable number since if 2n + 1 = P + q + 1 with
p and q prime, then s(pq) = 2n + 1. Can this be proved independently?
Are there arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive even numbers which are
untouchable? How large can the gaps between untouchable numbers be?
    Wouter Meeussen, in a 98-08-27 email, calls an integer m < n unre-
lated to n if it is neither a divisor of n nor relatively prime to it, and
defines the function W(n) = n - d(n) - ¢(n) + 1, the number of integers
unrelated to n. For n < 14 the only examples are: 4 unrelated to 6; 6
unrelated to 8 and 9; 4, 6, 8 unrelated to 10; and 8, 9, 10 unrelated to 12,
so that W(6) = W(8) = W(9) = 1 and W(10) = W(12) = 3. Meeussen

Bll Solutions of ma(m) = na(n).
Leo Moser observed that while n¢(n) determines n uniquely, na(n) does
not. [¢(n) is Euler's totient function; see B36.] For example, ma(m) =
na(n) for m = 12, n = 14. The multiplicativity of a(n) now ensures an
infinity of solutions, m = 12q, n = 14q, where q ..1 42. So Moser asked if
102                                   Unsolved Problems in Number Theory


there is an infinity of primitive solutions, in the sense that (m*, n*) is not
a solution for any m* = mid, n* = nld, d> 1. The example we've given
is the least of the set m = 2P - 1 (2 Q - 1), n = 2Q- 1 (2 P - 1), where 2P - 1,
2Q - 1 are distinct Mersenne primes, so that only a finite number of such
solutions is known. Another set of solutions is m = 27 . 32 .5 2 . (2 P - 1),
n = 2P - 1 .5 3 .17.31, where 2P - 1 is a Mersenne prime other than 3 or
31; also p = 5 gives a primitive solution on deletion of the common factor
31. There are other solutions, such as m = 24 .3.5 3 .7, n = 211 .5 2 and
m = 29 .5, n = 23 . 11· 31. An example with m 1.. n is m = 25 .5, n = 33 .7.
If mu(m) = nu(n), is min bounded?
     Erdos observed that if n is squarefree, then integers of the form nu(n)
are distinct. He also proved that the number of solutions of mu( m) = nu( n)
with m < n < x is ex + o(x). In answer to the question, are there three
distinct numbers 1, m, n such that 1u(1) = mu(m) = nu(n), Mq,kowski
observes that for distinct Mersenne primes Mpil 1 ::; i ::; s, we have nw(ni)
is constant for ni = AIMpil where A =       n;=l    Mpj . Is there an infinity of
primitive solutions of the equation u(a)la = u(b)lb? Without restricting
the solutions to being primitive, Erdos showed that their number with
a < b < x is at least ex + o(x); with the restriction a 1.. b no solution is
known at all.
     Erdos believes that the number of solutions of xu (x) = n is less than
n e/ In In n for every f. > 0, and says that the number may be less than (In n)c.
     Jean-Marie De Koninck asks if n = 1782 is the only non-trivial solution
of u(n) =(rad n)2, where rad n, the radical of n, is its greatest squarefree
divisor:
      u(1782) = u(2· 34 .11) = (2 + 1) . 3;-=-11 . (11 + 1) = (2·3·11)2

B12 Analogs with d(n), O"k(n).
Analogous questions may be asked with uk(n) in place of u(n), where uk(n)
is the sum of the k-th powers of the divisors of n. For example, are there
distinct numbers m and n such that mU2(m) = nU2(n)? For k = 0 we have

md(m) = nd(n) for (m, n) = (18,27), (24,32), (56,64) and (192,224). The
last pair can be supplemented by 168 to give three distinct numbers such
that ld(l) = md(m) = nd(n). There are primitive solutions (m, n) of shape



where p and q = u + p . 2tu are primes, but it does not immediately fol-
low that these are infinitely numerous. Many other solutions can be con-
structed; for example (2 70 ,2 63 .71), (3 19 ,3 17 .5) and (5 51 ,549 ·13).

B13 Solutions of O"(n) = O"(n + 1).
Sierpinski has asked if a(n) = a(n + 1) infinitely often. Hunsucker, Nebb
& Stearns extended the tabulations of Ml}kowski and of Mientka & Vogt
and have found just 113 solutions

          14, 206, 957, 1334, 1364, 1634, 2685, 2974, 4364, ...

less than 107 . They also obtain statistics concerning the equation a(n) =
a(n + l), of which Mientka & Vogt had asked: for what l (if any) is there
an infinity of solutions? They found many solutions if l is a factorial, but
only two solutions for l = 15 and l = 69. They also ask whether, for each
land m, there is an n such that a(n) + m = a(n + l).
    Jud McCranie found 832 solutions of a(n) = a(n+ 1) for n < 4.25 x 109
and 2189 solutions of a(n) = a(n + 2) in the same range. An example is

                      4236745811          64399 x 65789
                      4236745813          64499 x 65687

for which a(n) = a(n + 2) = 4236876000 = 25 .32 .53 .7.11 ·23·43. He
found no solutions for a(n) = a(n + 1) = a(n + 2) in that range.
    Hunsucker, Nebb & Stearns conjectured that if a(n) = a(n + 1) and
neither n nor n + 1 is squarefree, then n == 0 or -1 mod 4 but Haukkanen
gave the counterexamples n = 52586505 = 32 .5.71 . 109·151, n + 1 =
2.72 .43.12479 and n = 164233250 = 2.5 3 .353.1861, n+1 = 35 .72 .13.1061.

    He also observed that for no n :::; 2.108 is £1(n) = £1(n + 1) = £1(n + 2).
    If nand n + 2 are twin primes, then £1(n + 2) = £1(n) + 2. Ml}kowski
found the composite solutions n = 434, 8575, 8825 and Haukkanen showed
that these were the only ones :::; 2 . 108 .
    One can ask corresponding questions for £1k(n) , the sum of the k-th
powers of the divisors of n [For k = 0, see B15.] The only solution of
£12(n) = £12(n + 1) is n = 6, since £12(2n) > £12(2n + 1) for n > 7 and
£12(2n) > 5n 2 > (7r 2/8)(2n - 1)2 > £12(2n - 1). Note that £12(24) = £12(26);
Erdos doubts that £12(n) = £12(n + 2) has infinitely many solutions, and
thinks that £13(n) = £13(n + 2) has no solutions at all. De Koninck shows
that £12 (n) = £12 (n + l) has only finitely many solutions for l odd, whereas
Schinzel's Hypothesis H (see A) implies that there are infinitely many
solutions for l even.

BI5 Solutions of a(q) + a(r) = a(q + r).
Max Rumney (Eureka, 26(1963) 12) asked if the equation a(q) + a(r) =
a(q+r) has infinitely many solutions which are primitive in a sense similar
to that used in Bll. If q + r is prime, the only solution is (q, r) = (1,2).
If q + r = p2 where p is prime, then one of q and r, say q, is prime,
and r = 2n k 2 where n ?: 1 and k is odd. If k = 1, there is a solu-
tion if p = 2n - 1 is a and q = p2 - 2n is prime; this is so for n = 2,
3, 5, 7, 13 and 19. For k = 3 there are no solutions, and none for
k = 5 with n < 189. For k = 7, n = 1 and 3 give (q,r,q+r) =
(5231,2 . 72 ,732 ) and (213977,2 3 • 72 ,463 2 ). Other solutions are (k, n) =
(11,1) (11,3), (19,5), (25,1), (25,9), (49,9), (53,1), (97,5), (107,5), (131,5),
(137,1), (149,5), (257,5), (277,1), (313,3) and (421,3). Solutions with
q + r = p3 and p prime are a(2) + a(6) = a(8) and

                  a(11638687) + a(22 . 13 . 1123) = a(2273)

   Erdos asks how many solutions (not necessarily primitive) are there
with q + r < x; is it ex + o(x) or is it of higher order? If 81 < 82 < ... are
the numbers for which a(8i) = a(q) + a(8i - q) has a solution with q < 8i,
what is the density of the sequence {8i}?

BI6 Powerful numbers. Squarefree numbers.
Erdos & Szekeres studied numbers n such that if a prime p divides n, then pi
divides n where i is a given number greater than one. Golomb named these
numbers powerful and exhibited infinitely many pairs of consecutive ones.
In answer to his conjecture that 6 was not representable as the difference of
two powerful numbers, Wladyslaw Narkiewicz noted that 6 = 54 73 - 463 2 ,
and that there were infinitely many such representations. In fact in 1971
Richard P. Stanley (unpublished, since a simultaneous discovery was made
by Peter Montgomery) used the theory of the Bhaskara (Pell) equation
to show that every non-zero integer is the difference between two powerful
numbers and that 1 is the difference between two non-square powerful
numbers, each in infinitely many ways. A typical result of Stanley is that

if al = 39, bl = 1, an = 24335a n _l + 7176bn - l and
bn = 82524a n -l + 24335bn _ l , then 23(a n )2 - 23 3(b n )2 = 1.
    Many have investigated which numbers are the difference of two powers,
m P - n q , with m, n ~ 1, p, q ~ 2. Can any of the following numbers be so
expressed?
    6, 14, 34, 42, 50, 58, 62, 66, 70, 78, 82, 86, 90, 102, 110, 114, 130, 134,

    Erdos denotes by uik) < u~k) < ... the integers all of whose prime
factors have exponents ~ k; sometimes called k-full numbers. He asks
if the equation U~~l -    u?) = 1 has infinitely many solutions which do not
come from Pell equations x 2 _dy2 = ±1. Is there a constant c, such that the
number of solutions with Ui < x is less than (In x y? Does U~~l - u~3) = 1
               .                      .      (2)     (2)         (2)     (2)
have no solutIOns? Do the equatIOns Ui+2 - Ui+l = 1, ui+l - u i = 1 have
no simultaneous solutions? And several other questions, some of which
have been answered by Ml}kowski.
    For example, Ml}kowski notes that 73x 2 - 33y2 = 1 has infinitely many
solutions, and that this is not usually counted as a Bhaskara (Pell) equation.
He also notes that


are k-full numbers in A.P., and that if aI, a2, ... , as are k-full and in A.P.
with common difference d then
       al(as +d)k,      a2(a s +d)k,      ... ,
are s + 1 such numbers. As
ak(a l + .. .+l)k +ak+l(a l + .. .+l)k + .. .+ak+l(al + .. .+l)k = ak(a l + .. .+l)k+1,

the sum of l + 1 k-ful numbers can be k-full. He says that these last two
questions become difficult when we require that the numbers be relatively
prime. Heath-Brown has shown that every sufficiently large number is
the sum of three powerful numbers; his proof would be much shortened if
his conjecture could be proved that the quadratic form x 2 + y2 + 125z 2
represents every sufficiently large n == 7 mod 8. Erdos suggested that this
may follow from work of Duke and Iwaniec: in fact see the paper by Moroz.
    Are there only finitely many powerful numbers n such that n 2 - 1 is
also powerful? (See the Granville reference at D2.)
    If A(x) is the number of squareful integers::; x and ~(x) = A(x) -
alx l / 2 -a2xl/3 with a-I, a2 known constants, then, assuming the Riemann
Hypothesis, Cao showed that ~(x) = O(X 5 / 3 3+€), and Cai replaced 5/33
by 4/27.
    Liu Hong-Quan shows that the number of 3-full numbers in the interval
(x, x + d+ IL ) is asymptotic to CXIL if ~~ < /-L < ~.

    Nitaj proves the conjecture of Erdos that x + y = z has solutions in
relatively prime 3-full numbers, with Izl ---> 00. Cohn further shows that
this can be done infinitely often with none of x, y, z being a perfect cube.
    Gang Yu improves Menzer's estimate for the number of 4-full numbers
~ x from X35/3l6 (In x)3 to x3626/35461+€.
    Huxley & Trifonov show that the number of square-full numbers among
N + 1, ... , N + h is, for N sufficiently large in terms of f and h ~
~N~(lnN)fs is

Earlier results, with exponents ~, 0.6318, 0.6308, and i~ in place of ~,
were obtained by Bateman & Grosswald, Heath-Brown, Liu, and Filaseta
& Trifonov.
    If p is a prime, p == 1 (mod 4), and ~ (t + uJP) is the fundamental unit
of Q( JP) (i.e., (t, u) are the least positive integers satisfying the Bhaskara
equation t 2 - pu 2 = l),then the Ankeny-Artin-Chowla conjecture asserts
       t
that p u for any p. It was proved for all p < 10 11 by van der Poorten, te
Riele & Williams. The conjecture is false if p is not prime; Gerry Myerson
believes that 46 and 430 are the two smallest counterexamples.
    At the other end of the spectrum from the powerful numbers are the
squarefree numbers, with no repeated prime divisors. If we denote the
sequence of squarefree numbers by Un} = {I, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7,10, ... }, then it is
well known that in+! - in = 1 for infinitely many nand
limsup(fn+l - in) = 00. Panaitopol further shows that

                  limsup(minUn+l - in,jn - in-l}) = 00

and that if en = in+! - 2in + in-l and gn = i~+l - 2i~ + iLl' then each
of en < 0, en = 0, en > 0, gn < 0, gn > 0 holds for infinitely many n, and
gn =f 0 for all n > 1. He asks if there exist, for each positive integer k, an
index n such that in+! - in = k?

B 17 Exponential-perfect numbers
IT n = p~lp~2 ... p~r, then Straus & Subbarao call d an exponential
divisor (e-divisor) ofn if din and d = p~lp~2 ... p~r where bjlaj (1 S j S r),
and they call n e-perfect if O"e(n) = 2n, where O"e(n) is the sum of the
e-divisors of n. Some examples of e-perfect numbers are
     22 . 32, 22 . 33 . 52, 23 . 32 . 52, 24 . 32 . 11 2, 24. 33 . 52 . 11 2,

      and 219.32.55.72.112.132.192.372.792.1092.1572.3132.
    IT m is squarefree, O"e(m) = m, so if n is e-perfect and m is squarefree
with m ..1 n, then mn is e-perfect. So it suffices to consider only powerful
(B16) e-perfect numbers.
    Straus & Subbarao show that there are no odd e-perfect numbers, in fact
no odd n which satisfy 0"e (n) = kn for any integer k > 1. They also show
that for each r the number of (powerful) e-perfect numbers with r prime
factors is finite, and that the same holds for e-multiperfect numbers
(k > 2).

B18 Solutions of d(n) = d(n + 1).
Claudia Spiro has proved that d(n) = d(n + 5040) has infinitely many so-
lutions and Heath-Brown used her ideas to show that there are infinitely
many numbers n such that d( n) = d( n + 1), and Pinner has extended this
to d(n) = d(n + a) for any integer a. Many examples arise from pairs of
consecutive numbers which are products of just two distinct primes, and
it has been conjectured that there is an infinity of triples of consecutive
products of two primes, n, n + 1, n + 2. For example, n = 33, 85, 93, 141,
201, 213, 217, 301, 393, 445, 633, 697, 921, .... It is clearly not possible
to have four such numbers, but it is possible to have longer sequences of
consecutive numbers with the same number of divisors. For example,

                  d(242) = d(243) = d(244) = d(245) = 6   and
       d(40311) = d(40312) = d(40313) = d(40314) = d(40315) = 8.
How long can such sequences be?
    For 5 and 6 consecutive numbers, Haukkanen (see ref. at B13) showed
that the least n is respectively 11605 and 28374. In an 87-07-16 letter
Stephane Vandemergel sent the sequence of seven numbers: 171893 = 19 .
83 . 109, 171894 = 2 . 3 . 28649, 171895 = 5 ·31 . 1109, 171896 = 23 . 21487,
171897=3·11·5209,171898= 2·61·1409, 171899 = 7·13·1889,eachwith
8 divisors. In 1990, Ivo Diintsch & Roger Eggleton discovered several such
sequences of 7 numbers, two of 8 and one of 9, each with 48 divisors; the last
example starts at 17796126877482329126044, presumably not the smallest
of its kind. At the beginning of 2002 Jud McCranie gave 1043710445721
as the smallest first member of eight consecutive numbers with the same
number of divisors.
    Erdos believes that there are sequences oflength k for every k, but does
not see how to give an upper bound for k in terms of n.

        Erdos, Pomerance & Sarkozy showed that the number of n :::; x with
d(n) = d(n + 1) is « x/(lnlnx)1/2, and Hildebrand showed that this
number is» x/(lnlnx)3. The former authors also showed that the number
of n:::; x with the ratio d(n)/d(n + 1) in the set {2- 3, 2- 2 , 2-1, 1,2,22, 23}
is::::::: x/(lnlnx)1/2.
        Erdos showed that the density of numbers n with d( n + 1) > d( n) is ~.
This, with the above results, settles a conjecture of S. Chowla. Fabrykowski
& Subbarao extend this to the case with n + h in place of n + l.
        Erdos also lets
                           1 = d1 < d2 < ... < d7 = n
be the set of all divisors of n, listed in order, defines
                                       7-1

and asks us to prove that L~=l f( n) = (1 + o(l))x In x.
     Erdos & Mirsky ask for the largest k so that the numbers d( n), d( n + 1),
... , d(n + k) are all distinct. They only have trivial bounds; probably
k = (lnn)c.
     Farkas (see reference at E16) has shown that the set of rational numbers
~~/ contains all positive odd integers, and that ~~/ contains all integers
which are not multiples of 3.

BI9 (m, n + 1) and (m + 1, n) with same set of
prime factors. The abc-conjecture.
Motzkin & Straus asked for all pairs of numbers m, n such that m and n+ 1
have the same set of distinct prime factors, and similarly for nand m + 1.
It was thought that such pairs were necessarily of the form m = 2k + 1,
n = m 2 - 1 (k = 0, 1, 2, ... ) until Conway observed that if m = 5 . 7,
n + 1 = 54 ·7, then n = 2.3 7 , m + 1 = 22 .32. Are there others?
    Similarly, Erdos asks if there are numbers m, n (m < n) other than
m = 2k - 2, n = 2k(2k - 2) such that m and n have the same prime factors
and similarly for m + 1, n + 1. Milkowski found the pair m = 3.5 2, n = 35 .5
for which m + 1 = 22 . 19, n + 1 = 26 . 19. Compare problem B29.
    Pomerance has asked if there are any odd numbers n > 1 such that n
and u(n) have the same prime factors. He conjectures that there are not.
    The example 1 + 2 . 37 = 547 in the first paragraph is of interest in
connexion with the abc-conjecture@abc-conjecture:
    Many of the classical problems of number theory (Goldbach conjecture,
twin primes, the Fermat problem, Waring's problem, the Catalan conjec-
ture) owe their difficulty to a clash between multiplication and addition.
Roughly, if there's an additive relation between three numbers, their prime
factors can't all be small.
    Suppose that A + B = C with gcd(A, B, C) = 1. Define the radical R
to be the maximum squarefree integer dividing ABC and the power P by

                          P = Inmax(IAI, IBI, ICI)
                                     InR
then for a given 'f} > 1 are there only finitely many triples {A, B, C} with
P ~ 'f}? Another form of this conjecture is that limsupP = 1; both forms
of the conjecture seem to be hopelessly beyond reach.
    Joe Kanapka, a student of Noam Elkies, has produced a list of all ex-
amples with C < 232 and P > 1.2. There are nearly 1000 of them. The

    Browkin & Brzezinski generalize the abc-conjecture (which is their case
n = 3) to an "n-conjecture" on a1 + ... + an = 0 in coprime integers with
non-vanishing subsums. With Rand P defined analogously, they conjecture
that lim sup P = 2n - 5. They prove that limsupP;::: 2n - 5. They give a
lot of examples for the abc-conjecture with P > 1.4. Their method is to look
for rational numbers approximating roots of integers (note that the best
example above is connected to the good approximation 23/9 for 109 1 / 5 ).
Abderrahmane Nitaj used a similar method. Some of these were found
independently by Robert Styer (DlO). The Catalan relation 1 + 23 = 32
gives a comparatively poor P ~ 1.22629.
    For connexions between the abc-conjecture and the Fermat problem, see
the Granville references at D2. Indeed, if A = a P , B = bP, C = cP and the
Fermat equation A + B = C is satisfied, then Gerhard Frey's elliptic curve

                                 y2 = x(x - A)(x + B)

has discriminant 16(abc)2p.
   This area has had several stimuli: two being the proof of Fermat's
Last Theorem and the announcement of the Beal prize. I thank Andrew
Granville for the following remarks.

           The problem has been much studied recently by several au-
        thors. Darmon & Granville showed that if we fix integers x,
        y, z with l/x + l/y + l/z < 1 then there are only finitely
        many triples of coprime integers a, b, c satisfying aX + bY = cZ.
        This is proved independently of any assumption, and fits well
        with the conjecture that x, y, z > 2 imply that a, b, c have a
        common factor since in this case 1/x + 1/Y + 1/z < 1 unless
        x = y = z = 3, but of course Euler, and possibly Fermat, knew
        that there are no solutions in that case. Following this result
        there has been extensive computer searching and exactly ten

      solutions have been found with l/x + l/y + 1/ z < 1 and a, b, c
      coprime:

                    1 + 23 = 32     177 + 76271 3 = 210639282
                    25 + 72 = 34      14143 + 22134592 = 65 7
                   73 + 13 2 = 29   9262 3 + 153122832 = 1137
                  27 + 173 = 71 2   438 + 962223 = 300429072
                  35 + 114 = 1222    338 + 15490342 = 156133

           The five big solutions were found by clever computations by
      Beukers & Zagier. From this, several people have conjectured
      that the only solutions do have some exponent equal to 2, and
      wonder if this is always the case. Granville is loth to believe or
      disbelieve such a statement. For a year he and Cohen believed
      that the five small solutions above were the only five, and then
      were totally shocked by these computations - and he sees no
      good reason to suppose that we've seen the last of the solutions!
           The technique used by Darmon & Granville was to reduce
      the problem to applications of Faltings's Theorem. This is why
      they always say 'at most finitely many solutions'. Recently Dar-
      mon & Merel, and also Poonen, have revisited these problems,
      and tried to reduce several examples of x, y, z to applications
      of Wiles's Theorem (Darmon and Granville had done a couple
      of examples of this in their paper, but it is done much more
      skillfully in the recent papers). Darmon & Merel, and POD-
      nen, prove that there are no coprime solutions with exponents
      (x, x, 3) with x ~ 3.
           As Mauldin pointed out, the abc-conjecture is relevant to
      this. Gerald Tenenbaum has long suggested an explicit and
      plausible version of the abc-conjecture: If a + b = c in coprime
      positive integers then c :::; (product of plabc)2. Assuming then
      that aX + bY = CZ with a, b, c > 0 we'd have c(z/2) :::; abc <
      cz (l/x+l/y+1/ z ) and thus l/x + l/y + 1/ z > 1/2. This leaves us
      with a list of cases to consider if we insist that x, y, z > 2:
     (3,3,z > 3), (3,4,z > 3), (3,5,z > 4), (3,6,z > 6), (4,4,z > 4),
      and a finite list.

   I am also indebted to Andrew Bremner and the AMS for permission to
reproduce the review of Mauldin's paper:

          This note announces the award of a substantial monetary
      prize (since this article was written, fixed at $50,000) to any
      person who provides a solution to the "Beal Conjecture" , stated
      as the following: Let A, B, C, x, y, z be positive integers with

                                   c
      x, y, z > 2. If AX + BY = z (1), then A, B, C have a non-
      trivial common factor.
          The story of this conjecture is an interesting one, and told
      at slightly greater length in the author's follow-up letter to the
      Notices in March, 1998. Andrew Beal is a successful Texas
      businessman, with enthusiasm for number theory. He has a
      particular interest in Fermat and his methods, and evidently
      formulated this conjecture after several years of study following
      the announcement in 1993 of Andrew Wiles's work on Fermat's
      Last Theorem. So often, the amateur number-theorist turns
      out to be a well-intentioned crank; what is remarkable here is
      how close the stated problem is to current research activity by
      leaders in the field. In fact, the problem is essentially many
      decades old, and Brun [1914J asks many similar questions. The
      formulation in the 1980s by Masser, Oesterle & Szpiro of the
      abc-conjecture has had great influence on the discipline, and
      in fact a corollary of the abc-conjecture is that there are no
      solutions to the Beal Prize problem when the exponents are
      sufficiently large. The prize problem itself was implicitly posed
      by Andrew Granville in the Unsolved Problems section of the
      West Coast Number Theory Meeting, Asilomar, 1993 ("Find
      examples of xP + yq = zr with l/p + l/q + l/r < 1 other
      than 23 + 17 = 32 and 73 + 132 = 29 ,,), and is stated and
      discussed in van der Poortell's book "Notes on Fermat's Last
      Theorem" (1996). The resolution by Wiles of Fermat's Last
      Theorem disposes of a special case of the prize problem; and
      Darmon and Granville prove the deep result that if l/x+ l/y+
      1/ z < 1 then there can only be finitely many triples of coprime
      integers A, B, C satisfying AX + BY = CZ (ten solutions are
      known). Recently, Darmon & Merel have shown there can exist
      no coprime solutions to (1) with the exponents (x,x,3),x 2': 3.
          There has been some feeling expressed that the Conjecture
      should best be referred to as the "Beal Prize problem" , though
      there is no doubt that Andrew Beal after much computation
      independently arrived at and formulated the conjecture without
      knowledge of the current literature. With a nod to T. S. Eliot,
      the matter of naming Conjectures can be as difficult as the
      naming of Cats.

B20 Cullen and Woodall numbers.
Some interest has been shown in the Cullen numbers, n· 2n + 1, which
are all composite for 2 :::; n :::; 1000, except for n = 141. This is probably
a good example of the Law of Small Numbers, because for small n, where
the density of primes is large, the Cullen numbers are very likely to be
composite because Fermats (little) theorem@Fermat's (little) theorem tells
us that (p-1)2 P - 1 +1 and (P-2)2 P - 2 +1 are both divisible by p. Moreover,
as John Conway observes, the Cullen numbers are divisible by 2n -1 if that
is a prime of shape 8k ± 3. He asks if p and p . 2P + 1 can both be prime.
Wilfrid Keller notes that Conway's remark can be generalized as follows.
Write C n = n· 2n + 1, Wn = n· 2n - 1: then a prime p divides C(p+l)/2 and
W(3p-l)/2 or it divides C(3p-l)/2 and W(p+l)/2 according as the Legendre

symbol (see F5)   0)    is -lor +1. Known Cullen numbers include n = 1,
141, 4713, 5795, 6611, 18496, 32292, 32469, 59656, 90825, 262419 and
361275.
    The corresponding numbers (which have been called Woodall primes)
n· 2n - 1 are prime for n = 2, 3, 6, 30, 75, 81, 115, 123, 249, 362, 384, 462,
512 (i.e. M 521 ), 751, 822, 5312, 7755, 9531, 12379, 15822, 18885, 22971,
23005, 98726, 143018, 151023, 667071. In parallel with Conway's question
above, Keller notes that here 3, 751 and 12379 are primes.

B21 k· 2n + 1 composite for all n.
Let N(x) be the number of odd positive integers k, not exceeding x, such
that k . 2n + 1 is prime for no positive integer n. Sierpinski used covering
congruences (see F13) to show that N(x) tends to infinity with x. For
example, if

          k == 1 mod 641· (2 32 -1)   and    k == -1 mod 6700417,

then every member of the sequence k· 2n + 1 (n = 0, 1,2, ... ) is divisible
by just one of the primes 3, 5, 17, 257, 641, 65537 or 6700417. He also
noted that at least one of 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 241 will always divide k . 2n + 1
for certain other values of k.

      Erdos & Odlyzko have shown that




    What is the least value of k such that k· 2n + 1 is composite for all values
of n? Selfridge discovered that one of 3, 5, 7, 13, 19, 37, 73 always divides
78557 . 2n + 1. He also noted that there is a prime of the form k . 2 n + 1
for each k < 383 and Hugh Williams discovered the prime 383 . 26393 + 1.
    In the first edition we wrote that the determination of the least k may
now be within computer reach, though Keller has expressed his doubts
about this. Extensive calculations have been made by Baillie, Cormack
& Williams, by Keller, and by Buell & Young. Continuing activities by
these and many others, including seventeenorbust. com have reduced the
35 possibilities of the second edition to twelve. The answer seems almost
certain to be k = 78557, but there remain the possibilities

              4847     5359     10223    19249     21181    22699

    Riesel (see references at B20) investigated the corresponding question
for k . 2n - 1. For k = 509203, 762701, 992077, the covering set of divisors
is {3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 241}; for k = 777149, 790841, the covering set of divisors
is {3, 5, 7, 13, 19,37, 73}. There are no other values of k < 106 covered by
the following six covering sets given by Stanton:
{3,5, 7,13,19,37, 73}, {3,5,7, 13, 19,37, 109}, {3,5,7,11,13,31,41,61,151},
{3,5,7,11,13,19,31,37,41,61,181}, {3,5, 7,13, 17, 241}, {3,5,7, 13, 17,97, 257}.
It seems that k = 509203 is the smallest number such that k . 2n - 1
are all composite for every integer n > O. To show this, one needs a
prime k . 2n - 1 for each k < 509203. Many have been found; Wilfrid
Keller is organizing a search to find primes for the remaining 95 values (see

B22 Factorial n as the product of n large
factors.
Straus, Erdos & Selfridge have asked that n! be expressed as the product
of n factors, with the least one, l, as large as possible. For example, for
n = 56, l = 15,
56! = 15.163.173.188.192.2012.219.225.232.264.29.31. 37·41· 43·47·53

Selfridge has two conjectures:         (a) that, except for n = 56, l2: L2n/7J;
(b) that for n 2: 300000, l 2: n/3. If the latter is true, by how much can
300000 be reduced?
    Straus was reputed to have shown that for n > no = nO(E), l > n/(e+E),
but a proof was not found in his NachlaB. It is clear from Stirling's formula
that this is best possible. It is also clear that l is a monotonic, though not
strictly monotonic, increasing function of n. On the other hand it does not
take all integer values: for n = 124, 125, l is respectively 35 and 37. Erdos
asks how large the gaps in the values of l can be, and can l be constant for
arbitrarily long stretches?
    Alladi & Grinstead write n! as a product of prime powers, each as large
as n 8(n) and let a(n) = max8(n) and show that limn -+ oo a(n) = ec - 1 = a,
say, where
                 00 1     k
            c = "'" - In - -    so that   a = 0.809394020534 . .. .

                2

    If n! = p~1(n)p~2(n) ... pf!(n), where l = 7f(n). Erdos & Graham asked
if there exist, for every k, some n > 1 for which each of the exponents
al (n), a2 (n), ... , ak (n) is even. Berend proved that there are infinitely
many positive integers 1 = no < nl < n2 < ... such that for each j
all the numbers al (nj), a2 (nj), ... , ak (nj) are even. See also the papers of
Chen & Zhu, of Luca & Stanica, and of Sander. Chen later proved Sander's
conjecture that, given a set of primes, there are infinitely many n! whose
factorizations contain these primes with any specified pattern of parities.

B23 Equal products of factorials.
Suppose that n! = al!a2! ... ar!, r 2: 2, al 2: a2 2: ... 2: ar 2: 2. A trivial
example is al = a2! ... ar! -1, n = a2! ... ar! Dean Hickerson notes that the
only nontrivial examples with n ~ 410 are 9! = 7!3!3!2!, 10! = 7!6! = 7!5!3!
and 16! = 14!5!2! and asks if there are any others. Jeffrey Shallit & Michael
Easter have extended the search to n = 18160 and Chris Caldwell has
shownthat any other n is greater than 106 •
    Erdos observes that if P(n) is the largest prime factor of n and if it
were known that P(n(n + l))jlnn tends to infinity with n, then it would
follow that there are only finitely many nontrivial examples.
    He & Graham have studied the equation y2 = al!a2! ... ar! They define
the set Fk to be those m for which there is a set of integers m = al > a2 >
... > ar with r ~ k which satisfies this equation for some y, and write
Dk for Fk - Fk- 1 . They have various results, for example: for almost all
primes p, 13p does not belong to F5 ; and the least element of D6 is 527. If
D4(n) is the number of elements of D4 which are ~ n, they do not know
the order of growth of D 4 (n). They conjecture that D6(n) > en but cannot
prove this.

B24 The largest set with no member dividing
two others.
Let f(n) be the size of the largest subset of [1, n] no member of which
divides two others. Erdos asks how large can f(n) be? By taking
[m + 1, 3m + 2] it is clear that one can have r2n/31. D.J. Kleitman shows
that f(29) = 21 by taking [11,30] and omitting 18, 24 and 30, which then
allows the inclusion of 6, 8, 9 and 10. However, this example does not seem
to generalize. In fact Lebensold has shown that if n is large, then

Erdos also asks if lim f (n ) / n is irrational.
   Dually, one can ask for the largest number of numbers ::; n, with no
number a multiple of any two others. Kleitman's example serves this pur-
pose also. More generally, Erdos asks for the largest number of numbers

with no one divisible by k others, for k > 2. For k = 1, the answer is n/21.

B25 Equal sums of geometric progressions
with prime ratios.
Bateman asks if 31 = (25 - 1)/(2 - 1) = (53 - 1)/(5 - 1) is the only prime
which is expressible in more than one way in the form (pr - 1) / (p - 1)
where p is prime and r ~ 3 and d ~ 1 are integers. Trivially one has
7 = (23 - 1)/(2 - 1) = ((-3)3 - 1)/(-3 - 1), but there are no others
< lO lD . If the condition that p be prime is relaxed, the problem goes back

    E. T. Parker observed that the very long proof by Feit & Thompson
that every group of odd order is solvable would be shortened if it could be
proved that (Pq - 1) / (p - 1) never divides (qP - 1) / (q - 1) where p, q are
distinct odd primes. In fact it has been conjectured that that these two
expressions are relatively prime, but Nelson Stephens noticed that when
p = 17, q = 3313 they have a common factor 2pq + 1 = 112643. McKay

has established that p2 + p + 1 3P - 1 for p < 53 . 106 .
    Karl Dilcher quotes Nelson Stephens to the effect that if pq -1 and qP-1
have a common factor r, then r is of shape 2>..pq + 1 and has searched with
all such r < 8.10 10 . Also with 1 ~ >.. ~ 10 and p < q < 107 , and with

B26 Densest set with no l pairwise coprime.
Erdos asks what is the maximum k so that the integers ai, 1 ~ a1 < a2 <
. .. < ak ~ n have no I among them which are pairwise relatively prime.
He conjectures that this is the number of integers ~ n which have one of
the first I - I primes as a divisor. He says that this is easy to prove for
I = 2 and not difficult for I = 3; he offers $10.00 for a general solution.
     Dually one can ask for the largest subset of [1, n] whose members have
pairwise least common multiples not exceeding n. If g( n) is the cardinality
of such a maximal subset, then Erdos showed that

                          _3_ n1/ 2 _ 2 < g(n) < 2n 1/ 2
                          20                    -
where the first inequality follows by taking the integers from 1 to (n/2)1/2
together with the even integers from (n/2)1/2 to (2n)1/2. Choi improved
the upper bound to 1.638n 1 / 2 •

B27 The number of prime factors of n + k
which don't divide n + i, 0 < i < k.
Erdos & Selfridge define v( n; k) as the number of prime factors of n + k
which do not divide n + i for 0 S i < k, and vo(n) as the maximum of
v(n; k) taken over all k ~ O. Does vo(n) --+ 00 with n? They show that
vo(n) > 1 for all n except 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 16. More generally, define
vl(n) as the maximum of v(n; k) taken over k ~ l. Does vl(n) --+ 00 with
n? They are unable to prove even that vI(n) = 1 has only a finite number
of solutions. Probably the greatest n for which VI (n) = 1 is 330.
    They also denote by V (n; k) the number of primes p for which po. is
the highest power of p dividing n + k, but pO! does not divide n + i for
o S i < k, and by Vi(n) the maximum of V(n; k) taken over k ~ l. Does
VI(n) = 1 have only a finite number of solutions? Perhaps n = 80 is the
largest solution. What is the largest n such that Vo(n) = 2?
    Some further problems are given in their paper.

B28 Consecutive numbers with distinct
prime factors.
Selfridge asked: do there exist n consecutive integers, each having either
two distinct prime factors less than n or a repeated prime factor less than
n? He gives two examples:
    The numbers a+11+i (1 SiS n = 115) where a = 0 mod 223 25272112
and a + p = 0 mod p2 for each prime p, 13 S p S 113, and

   The numbers a + 31 + i (1 ::; i ::; n = 1329) where a + p ::= 0 mod p2 for
each prime p, 37::;p::; 1327 and a::=Omod22325272U2132172192232292312.

    It is harder to find examples of n consecutive numbers, each one divisible
by two distinct primes less than n or by the square of a prime < n/2, though
he believes that they could be found by computer.
    This is related to the problem: find n consecutive integers, each having
a composite common factor with the product of the other n - 1. If the
composite condition is relaxed, and one asks merely for a common factor
greater than 1, then 2184 + i (1 ::; i ::; n = 17) is a famous example.

Alan R. Woods asks if there is a positive integer k such that every x is
uniquely determined by the (sets of) prime divisors of x + 1, x + 2, ... ,
x + k. Perhaps k = 3?
    For primes less than 23 there are four ambiguous cases for k = 2:
(x+1,x+2) = (2,3) or (8,9); (6,7) or (48,49); (14,15) or (224,225); (75,76)

B30 A small set whose product is square.
Erdos, Graham & Selfridge want us to find the least value of tn so that the
integers n + 1, n + 2, ... , n + tn contain a subset the product of whose
members with n is a square. The Thue-Siegel theorem implies that tn --t 00
with n, faster than a power of In n.
    I was asked for a justification or reference for this last sentence. Andrew
Granville kindly supplied the following comments:

         The point is that if you do have such a subset then there is
      an integer point (n, m) on some hyperelliptic curve



      where 0 < ii < i2 < ... < ik :S tn. If tn were to be < T for
      infinitely many n then some such curve would have infinitely
      many rational points (or even integer points), contradicting
      Faltings's Theorem if k 2: 3, and Thue's Theorem for k 2: o.
      Thus tn --t 00.
          More difficult would be to estimate quite how fast we can
      prove tn --t 00. To do this one needs some effective version of
      Faltings's or Thue's Theorem. There is probably a pretty good
      effective version of Thue's Theorem, especially for hyperelliptic
      curves.
          It is amusing to note that the abc-conjecture is certainly ap-
      plicable to this question, via Elkies's paper (see ref. at B19) or
      Langevin, though this would take some working out. Presum-
      ably tn > n C for some c> 0 (assuming abc) though I have not
      proved this! Perhaps Silverman is interested in this question.

   Joseph Silverman responded:
          Granville's argument that tn --t 00 is fine, but it depends on
      the fact that a hyperelliptic curve has only finitely many integer
      points (due to Siegel, I believe, not Thue). It seems to me that
      Theorem 1 of my paper with Evertse might be helpful. Let



      and assume that k 2: 3, since the case k = 2 can be dealt with
      separately. Then Theorem l(b) can be applied with K = Q,
      m = 1, S is the infinite place of Q together with the primes
      dividing D(f), the discriminant of I, s = lSI = 1 + v(D(f)),
      Rs is the ring of S-integers in Q, L = K = Q, M = 1, n = 2,
      "'n(L) = o. This appears to give that the number of integer
      solutions to y2 = I(X) is :S 74+98 = 713+9v(D(f)).

    Selfridge (W. No. Theory problem 97:22) says that it is conjectured
that 6 and 392 are the only numbers of shape n = rs2 with r > 1 and
squarefree for which there do not exist a, b with n < a < b < r(s + 1)2 and
nab a square.
    To revert to the opening paragraph, Selfridge has shown that tn :::;
max(P(n) , 3 yin) , where P(n) is the largest prime factor of n.
    Alternatively, is it true that for every c there is an no so that for every
n > no the products IT ai, taken over n < al < ... < ak < n + (In n)C
(k = 1, 2, ... ) are all distinct? Erdos, Graham & Selfridge proved this
for c < 2.
    Selfridge conjectures that if n is not a square, and t is the next larger
number than n such that nt is a square, then, unless n = 8 or 392, it
is always possible to find rand s, n < r < s < t such that nrs is a
square. E.g., if n = 240 = 24 3 . 5 then t = 375 = 3 . 53 and we can
find r = 243 = 35 and s = 245 = 5 . 72 . Selfridge and Meyerowitz have
confirmed the conjecture for n < 1030000.

B31 Binomial coefficients.
Earl Ecklund, Roger Eggleton, Erdos & Selfridge (see B23) write the
binomial coefficient (~) = n!/k!(n - k)! as a product UV in which every
prime factor of U is at most k and every prime factor of V is greater than
k. There are only finitely many cases with n ~ 2k for which U > V. They
determine all such cases except when k = 3, 5 or 7.

      Most binomial coefficients (~) with n 2': 2k have a prime factor p :::; n/k.
After some computing with Lacampagne & Erdos, Selfridge conjectured
that this inequality is true whenever n > 17.125k. A slightly stronger
conjecture is that any such binomial coefficient has least prime factor p :::;

      Erdos & Selfridge noted that if n 2': 2k 2': 4, then there is at least one
value of i, 0 :::; i :::; k - 1, such that n - i does not divide (~), and asked
for the least nk for which there was only one such i. For example, n2 = 4,
n3 = 6, n4 = 9, n5 = 12. nk :::; k! for k 2': 3.
      For a positive integer k, the Erdos-Selfridge function is the least integer
g(k) > k + 1 such that all prime factors of (g~)) exceed k. The first few
values are
  k=         2   3   4     5    6     7      8     9    10    11     12     13

They are far from being monotonic. Ecklund, Erdos & Selfridge conjecture
that limsup & liminf of g(k + 1)/g(k) are 00 & O. They also conjecture
that, for each n and for k > ko(n), g(k) > k n , that limg(k)l/k = 1 and
that g(k) < e C7r (k). For example, they conjecture that g(k) > k 3 for k > 35
and that g(k) > k 5 for k > 100. They show that g(k) < k2LkPI with

    A problem which has briefly baffled good mathematicians is: is (;)

Erdos & Szekeres ask if the greatest prime factor of the g.c.d. is always

    On 98-01-12 David Gale reported that a Berkeley student proposed a
natural generalization, of the noncoprimality of two binomial coefficients, to
trinomial coeffients, with the further generalization to k-nomial coefficients.
Ifn = a+b+c, let T(n;a,b,c) = n!/(a!b!c!). The conjecture, supported by
fairly extensive computer evidence, is that for 0 < a, b, c < n, every three
T(n; a, b, c) have a common factor. George Bergman and Hendrik Lenstra
and others have some relevant partial results.
    Wolstenholme's theorem states that if n is a prime> 3, then

There are no composite solutions for n < 109 and it is conjectured that
there are none. Call a prime p satisfying e:~l) ==: 1 mod p4 a Wolsten-
holme prime. McIntosh shows that p is Wolstenholme just if it divides
the numerator of the Bernoulli number B p - 3 (see A17). The two known

B32 Grimm's conjecture.
Grimm has conjectured that if n + 1, n + 2, ... , n + k are all composite,
then there are distinct primes Pij such that Pij I(n + j) for 1 :S j :S k. For
example
               1802 1803 1804 1805 1806 1807 1808 1809 1810

   Ramachandra, Shorey & Tijdeman proved, under the hypothesis of
Schinzel mentioned in A2, that there are only finitely many exceptions
to Grimm's conjecture.
   Erdos & Selfridge asked for an estimate of f (n), the least number such
that for each m there are distinct integers aI, a2, ... , a 1r (n) in the interval
[m+ 1, m+ f(n)] with Pilai where Pi is the ith prime. They and Pomerance
show that, for large n,
                       (3 - E)n:S f(n) ~ n 3/ 2(lnn)-1/2

where each ai divides m + i and gcd( ai, aj) = 1 when i =I- j. They claim
that Grimm's conjecture is a consequence of their own conjecture that if
m + 1, m + 2, ... , m + k are composite, then each of the ai > l.

B33 Largest divisor of a binomial coefficient.
What can one say about the largest divisor, less than n, of the binomial
coefficient (~) = n!/k!(n - k)! ? Erdos points out that it is easy to show
that it is at least n/k and conjectures that there may be one between en
and n for any e < 1 and n sufficiently large. Marilyn Faulkner showed that
if p is the least prime > 2k and n ~ p, then (~) has a prime divisor ~ p,
except for  m    and C30). Earl Ecklund showed that if n ~ 2k > 2 then (~)
has a prime divisor p :S n/2, except for G).
    John Selfridge conjectures that if n ~ k 2 - 1, then, apart from the
exception (662 ), there is a prime divisor :S n/ k of (~). Among those binomial
coefficients whose least prime factor p is ~ n/k there may be only a finite
number with p ~ 13, but there could be infinitely many with p = 7. That
there are infinitely many with p = 5 was proved by Erdos, Lacampagne &
Selfridge (B31).
    A classical theorem, discovered independently by Sylvester and Schur,
stated that the product of k consecutive integers, each greater than k, has
a prime divisor greater than k. Leo Moser conjectured that the Sylvester-
Schur theorem holds for primes == 1 mod 4, in the sense that for n suffi-
ciently large (and ~ 2k), (~) has a prime divisor == 1 mod 4 which is greater
than k. However, Erdos does not think that this is true, but it may not be
at all easy to settle. In this connexion John Leech notices that the fourteen
integers 280213, ... , 280226 have no prime factor of the form 4m + 1 > 13.

    Thanks to Ira Gessel and John Conway, we can say that the generaliza-
tion of the Catalan numbers n~l         e:),
                                        requested in the first edition by

and Euclid knew that (n, r) is a linear combination of nand r). These are

also known as generalized ballot numbers and they occur when enumerating
certain lattice paths.
    If f(n) is the sum of the reciprocals of those primes < n which do not
dividee:),     then Erdos, Graham, Ruzsa & Straus conjectured that there
is an absolute constant c so that f(n) < c for all n. Erdos also conjectured
that e:)    is never squarefree for n > 4. Since 41  e:)  unless n = 2k, it
suffices to consider



Sark6zy proved this for n sufficiently large and Sander has shown, in a
precise sense, that binomial coefficients near the centre of the Pascal tri-
angle are not squarefree. Granville & Raman§ completed Sark6zy's proof
by showing that k > 300000 was sufficiently large, and checking it com-
putationally for 2 S k S 300000. They also improved Sander's result by
showing that there is a constant 8, 0 < 8 < 1, such that if (~) is squarefree
then k or n - k must be < nO for sufficiently large n. They conjecture that
k or n - k must in fact be < (In n )2-8, and that this is best possible in the
sense that there are infinitely many squarefree (~) with ~n > k > c(ln n)2
for some c > O. They prove such a result for ~n > k > sIn n. They show
that there is a constant Pk > 0 such that the number of n S N with (~)
squarefree is PkN. Since Pk < c/k 2 for some c> 0, they conjecture that
              f"V


there is a constant "( > 0 such that the number of squarefree entries in the
first N rows of Pascal's triangle is "(N.
                                    f"V


    Erdos has also conjectured that for k > 8, 2k is not the sum of distinct
powers of 3 [28 = 35 + 32 + 3 + 1]. If that's true, then for k ::::: 9,




In answer to the question, is (~ii) the largest   e:)   which is not divisible
by the square of an odd prime, Eugene Levine gave the examples n = 784
and 786. Erdos feels sure that there are no larger such n.
    Denote by e = e(n) the largest exponent such that, for some prime p,
pe divides  e:).   It is not known whether e -+ 00 with n. On the other
hand Erdos cannot disprove e > c In n.
    Ron Graham offers $100.00 for deciding if (e:), 105) = 1 infinitely
often. Kummer knew that n, when written in base 3 or 5 or 7, would have
to have only the digits 0, 1 or 0, 1, 2 or 0, 1, 2, 3 respectively. H. Gupta
& S. P. Khare found the 14 values 1, 10, 756, 757, 3160, 3186, 3187, 3250,
7560, 7561, 7651, 20007, 59548377, 59548401 of n less than 710 , while Peter
Montgomery, Khare and others found many larger values.
    Erdos, Graham, Ruzsa & Straus showed that for any two primes p, q
there are infinitely many n for which ((2:),pq) = 1. If g(n) is the smallest

B34 If there's an i such that n - i divides (~).
If Hk,n is the proposition: there is an i, 0 ::; i < k such that n - i divides
(~), then Erdos asked if Hk,n is true for all k when n 2: 2k. Schinzel gave
the counterexample n = 99215, k = 15. If Hk is the proposition: Hk,n is
true for all n, then Schinzel showed that Hk is false for k = 15, 21, 22, 33,
35 and thirteen other values of k. He showed that Hk is true for all other
k ::; 32 and asked if there are infinitely many k, other than prime-powers,
for which H k is true: he conjectures not and later reported that it is true
for k = 34, but for no other non-prime-powers between 34 and 201.

B35 Products of consecutive numbers with
the same prime factors.
Let f(n) be the the least integer such that at least one of the numbers n,
n + 1, ... , n + f(n) divides the product of the others. It is easy to see that
f(k!) = k and f(n) > k for n > k! Erdos has also shown that
                            f(n) > exp((lnn)1/2-<)
for an infinity of values of n, but it seems difficult to find a good upper
bound for f(n).

    Erdos asks if (m + 1)(m + 2)··· (m + k) and (n + 1)(n + 2)··· (n + I)
with k ~ 1 ~ 3 can contain the same prime factors infinitely often. For
example (2 . 3 . 4 . 5 . 6) . 7 . 8 . 9 . 10 and 14 . 15 . 16 and 48 . 49 . 50; also
(2 . 3 . 4 . 5 . 6) . 7 . 8 . 9 . 10 . 11 . 12 and 98 . 99 . 100. For k = 1 ~ 3 he
conjectures that this happens only finitely many times.
    If L(n; k) is the I.c.m. of n + 1, n + 2, ... , n + k, then Erdos conjectures
that for 1 > 1, n ~ m + k, L(m; k) = L(n; 1) has only a finite number
of solutions. Examples are L(4; 3) = L(13; 2) and L(3; 4) = L(19; 2). He
asks if there are infinitely many n such that for all k (1 ::; k < n) we
have L(n; k) > L(n - k; k). What is the largest k = k(n) for which this
inequality can be reversed? He notes that it is easy to see that k(n) = o(n),
but he believes that much more is true. He expects that for every f > 0
and n > nO(f), k(n) < nl/HE but cannot prove this.

B36 Euler's totient function.
Euler's totient function, ¢(n), is the number of numbers not greater than

¢(5) = ¢(8) = ¢(1O) = ¢(12) = 4, ¢(7) = ¢(9) = 6. Are there infinitely
many pairs of consecutive numbers, n, n + 1, such that ¢(n) = ¢(n + 1)?
For example, n = 1, 3, 15, 104, 164, 194, 255, 495, 584, 975. It is not even
known if I¢(n + 1) - ¢(n)1 < n E has an infinity of solutions for each f > O.
Jud McCranie found 1267 solutions of ¢(n) = ¢(n + 1) with n < 101 0,
the largest of which is n = 9985705185, ¢(n) = ¢(n + 1) = 211 357. 11.
He also looked for solutions of ¢(n + k) = ¢(n). Schinzel conjectures that
for every even k there are infinitely many solutions, but observes that the
corresponding conjecture with k odd is implausible. Indeed, when k is an
odd multiple of 3, in a search to n = 10 10 , McCranie found only a few
solutions. For k = 3 only n = 3 and n = 5. In fact, the only value of
k == 3 (mod 6) which yielded as many as 13 solutions was k = 141 and
the largest solution found was n = 715 with k = 245, except that k = 27
yielded a very atypical n = 4135966808. Other odd k were still yielding a
steady supply of solutions; the most for k < 101 being 1673 solutions for
k = 47, and the least being 278 for k = 55, except that k = 35 gave only
29 solutions, 12 of them> 109, including n = 9423248800.
    Sierpinski has shown that there is at least one solution for each k and
Schinzel & Wakulicz that there are at least two for each k < 2 . 1058 . For
even k Holt raises this to k < 1.38 . 1026595411.
    Ml}kowski has shown that ¢(n + k) = 2¢(n) has at least one solution
for every k. For the equation ¢(n+k) = 3¢(n) see the solution to Problem
E3215 in Amer. Math. Monthly, 96(1989) 63-64.

    McCranie found no solutions of ¢(n+k) = ¢(n)+¢(k) for k = 3, nor any
of ¢(n) = ¢(n+1) = ¢(n+2), for n < 10 10 , apartfrom ¢(5186) = ¢(5187) =
¢(5188) = 25 34 • Other curiosities are ¢(25930) = ¢(25935) = ¢(25940) =
¢(25942) = 27 34 and ¢(404471) = ¢(404473) = ¢(404477) = 28 32527.
    Graham, Holt & Pomerance can show that I¢(n) - ¢(n + 2)1 < n 9 / 1O
infinitely often by looking at n = 2(2p - 1), where p is a prime, and using
a theorem of Chen that says that there are infinitely many primes p such
that either 2p - 1 is a prime or 2p - 1 is a product of two prime factors,
both of which exceed p1/1O. With a little work, they could improve the
9/10 exponent. On the other hand, they don't see any similar argument
for I¢(n) - ¢(n + 1)1. This seems to be a fundamentally different problem.
    Erdos lets a1, ... ,at be the longest sequence for which
                  a1 < ... < at ::; n and ¢(a1) < ... < ¢(at)
and suggests that t = 7r(n). Can one even prove t < (1 + o(l))7r(n) or at
least t = o(n)? Similar questions can be asked about a(n).
    Nontotients are positive even values of n for which ¢(x) = n has no
solution; for example, n = 14, 26, 34, 38, 50, 62, 68, 74, 76, 86, 90, 94,
98. The number, #(y), of these less than y has been calculated by the
Lehmers.

   #(y) 210 2627 5515 8458 11438 14439 17486 20536 23606 26663
    Zhang Ming-Zhi has shown that for every positive integer m, there is a
prime p such that mp is a nontotient.
    Browkin & Schinzel have proved the conjecture of Sierpinski and Erdos
that there are infinitely many noncototients, by showing that none of the
numbers 2k ·509203, k = 1, 2, ... is of the form x - ¢(x).
    Erdos & Hall have shown that the number, <I>(y) = y - #(n), of n
for which ¢(x) = n has a solution is ye!(Y)/lny, where f(y) lies between
c(lnlnlny)2 and c(lny)1/2. Maier & Pomerance more recently showed that
the lower bound was correct, with c ~ 0.8178. Erdos conjectures that
<I>(cy)/<I>(y) ---+ c, and that this, if true, may be the best substitute that one
can find for an asymptotic formula for <I>(y).
    Noncototients are positive values of n for which x - ¢(x) = n has no
solution; for example, n = 10, 26, 34, 50, 52, 58, 86, 100. Sierpinski and
Erdos conjecture that there are infinitely many noncototients.
    Erdos once asked if it was true that for every f there is an n with
¢(n) = m, m < En and for no t < n is ¢(t) = m; perhaps there are many
such n.
    Michael Ecker has asked for which values of x do each of the series
2:::=1 ¢(n)/nx and 2:::=1(-1)n+l¢(n)/nx converge.
    David Angell, in Western Number Theory problem 003:03, asks if there

   Donald Newman has shown that if a, b, e, d are nonnegative integers
with a, e > 0 and ad - be -=I- 0, then there exists a positive integer n such
that /phi(an + b) < ¢(en + d), but there is no such n < 2.106 such that
¢(30n + 1) < ¢(30n). In fact Greg Martin showed that that the least such
n has 1116 decimal digits.

B37 Does ¢(n) properly divide n - I?
D. H. Lehmer has conjectured that there is no composite value of n such
that cf>(n) is a divisor of n - 1, i.e., that for no value of n is cf>(n) a proper
divisor ofn-l. Such an n must be a Carmichael number (Al3). He showed
that it would have to be the product of at least seven distinct primes, and
Lieuwens has shown that if 31n, then n > 5.5·10571 and w(n) ~ 212; if
the smallest prime factor of n is 5, then w(n) ~ 11; if the smallest prime
factor of n is at least 7, then w(n) ~ 13. This supersedes and corrects
the work of Schuh. Masao Kishore has shown that at least 13 primes are
needed in any case, and Cohen & Hagis have improved this to 14. Siva
Rama Prasad & Subbarao improve Lieuwens's 212 result to w(n) ~ 1850
and Hagis to w(n) ~ 298848. Siva Rama Prasad & Rangamma show that
if 31n, n composite, Mcf>(n) = n - 1, M =I- 4, then w(n) ~ 5334.
    Pomerance has proved that the number of composite n less than x for
which cf>(n) I n - 1 is



and Shan Zun improved the exponent ~ to ~.
    Schinzel notes that if n = p or 2p, where p is prime, then cf>( n) + 1
divides n and asks if the converse is always true. Segal (see paper with
Cohen) observes that Schinzel's question reduces to that of Lehmer, that it
arises in group theory, and may have been raised by G. Hajos (see Miech's
paper, though there it is attributed to Gordon).
    Lehmer gives eight solutions to cf>(n) I n+1, namely n = 2, n = 22k - 1
for 1 :::; k :::; 5, n = n1 = 3· 5 . 17 . 353 . 929 and n = n1 . 83623937. [Note
that 353 = 11 . 25 + 1, 929 = 29.2 5 + 1, 83623937 = 11 .29.2 18 + 1 and
(353-2 8 )(929-2 8 ) = 216 _2 8 +1.] This exhausts the solutions with less than
seven factors. Victor Meally notes that n = n1 ·83623937·699296672132097
would be a solution were the largest factor a prime, but Peter Borwein notes
that this is divisible by 73. The Borweins & Roland Girgensohn conjecture
that there are no more solutions.
    See Erick Wong's thesis, quoted at Al7.
    If n is prime, it divides cf>(n)d(n) + 2. Is this true for any composite n
other than n = 4? Subbarao also notes that if n is prime, then na(n) ==
2 mod cf>(n), and also only if n = 4,6 or 22. Jud McCranie finds no others
with n < 1010 for either problem.
    Subbarao has an analogous conjecture to Lehmer's, based on the func-
tion cf>·(n) = TI(pa -1), where the product is taken over the maximal prime
power divisors of n, palin. He conjectures that cf>·(n)l(n-1) if and only if n

is a power of a prime. He also has a 'dual' of Lehmer's conjecture, namely
that 'ljJ(n) == 1 mod n only when n is a prime, where 'ljJ(n) is Dedekind's
function (see B41). Again, Jud McCranie finds no counterexamples < 1010
to either of these conjectures.
    Ron Graham makes the following conjecture
   l,   For all k there are infinitely many n such that ¢( n) I(n - k)     ?
and he observes that it is true, for example, for k = 0, k = 2a (a ~ 0) and
for k = 2a 3b (a, b> 0). Pomerance (see Acta Arith. paper quoted at B2)
has treated Graham's problem.

B3S Solutions of ¢(m) = a(n).
Are there infinitely many pairs of numbers m, n such that ¢(m) = a(n)?
Since for P prime ¢(p) = p - 1 and a(p) = p + 1 this question would
be answered affirmatively if there were infinitely many twin primes (A7).
Also if there were infinitely many Mersenne primes (A3) Mp = 2P -1, since
a(Mp) = 2P = ¢(2P+1 ). However there are many solutions other than these,
sometimes displaying little noticeable pattern, e.g., ¢(780) = 192 = 17(105).

      Erdos remarks that the equation ¢( x) = n! is solvable, and (apart from
n = 2) a(y) = n! is probably solvable also. Charles R. Wall can show that
'lj;(n) = n! is solvable for n -I 2, where 'lj; is Dedekind's function (see B41).

   Jean-Marie De Koninck asks if R is the radical of n, i.e., the greatest
squarefree divisor of n, then are n = 1 and 1782 the only solutions of
a(n) = R2 ?

B39 Carmichael's conjecture.
Carmichael's conjecture. For every n it appears to be possible to find
an m, not equal to n, such that ¢( m) = ¢( n) and for a few years early
in the last century it was thought that Carmichael had proved this. Klee
verified the conjecture for ¢( n) < 10400 , and for all ¢( n) not divisible by
242 . 347 . Masai & Valette have raised the bound to 10100000, and Schlafly
& Wagon to 1010900000. Pomerance has shown that if n is such that for
every prime p for which p - 1 divides ¢( n) we have p2 divides n, then n is a
counterexample. He can also show (unpUblished) that if the first k primes
p == 1 (mod q) (where q is prime) are all less than qk+l, then there are no
numbers n which satisfy his theorem. This also implies the truth of his
conjecture that Pk - 11 I1i<k Pi (Pi - 1). The truth of this last conjecture for
all k also implies that there are no numbers n which satisfy his theorem.
    Define the multiplicity of an integer as the number of times it occurs
as a value of ¢(n). For example, 6 has multiplicity 4 because ¢(n) = 6
for n = 7, 9, 14, 18 and no other values of n. The multiplicity may be

zero (for any odd n > 1, and n = 14, 26, 34, ... ), but not, according to
the Carmichael conjecture, equal to one. Sierpinski conjectured that all
integers greater than 1 occur as multiplicities and Erdos has shown that if
a multiplicity occurs once it occurs infinitely often. Kevin Ford has proved
Sierpinski's conjecture. He also showed that if there is a counterexam-
ple to Carmichael's conjecture, then a positive proportion of totients are
counterexamples.
    There are examples of even numbers n such that there is no odd number
m such that ¢( m) = ¢(n). Lorraine Foster has given n = 33817088 =
29 . 257 2 as the least such.
    Erdos proved that if ¢(x) = k has exactly s solutions, then there are
infinitely many other k for which there are exactly s solutions, and that
s > kC for infinitely many k. If C is the least upper bound of those c for
which this is true, then Wooldridge showed that C ~ 3 - 2v'2 > 0.17157.
Pomerance used Hooley's improvement on the Brun-Titchmarsh theorem
to improve this to C ~ 1 - 625/512e > 0.55092 and notes that further
improvements by Iwaniec enable him to get C > 0.55655 so that s > k 5 / 9
for infinitely many k. Erdos conjectures that C = 1. In the other direction
Pomerance also shows that

                  s < kexp{-(l+o(l))lnklnlnlnk/lnlnk}

and gives a heuristic argument to support the belief that this is best pos-
sible.

B40 Gaps between totatives.
If al < a2 < ... < a</>(n) are the integers less than n and prime to it, then
Erdos conjectured that E(ai+l -ai)2 < cn 2j¢>(n) and offered $500.00 for a
proof. Hooley showed that, for 1 :::; a < 2, E(ai+l - ai)<> « n(nj¢>(n))<>-I
and that E(ai+1 - ai)2« n(lnlnn)2, Vaughan established the conjecture
"on the average" and he & Montgomery finally won the prize.
    Jacobsthal asked what bounds can be placed on the maximum gap,
J(n) = max(ai+1 - ai). Erdos asks if, for infinitely many x, there are two
integers nl, n2, ni < n2 < x, ni J.. n2, with J(nl) > lnx, J(n2) > lnx.

each k, it contains an arithmetic progression of length k.

B41 Iterations of ¢ and (J.

Pomerance asks if, for each positive integer n, there is a positive integer
k such that ak(n)/n is an integer. E.g., (n, k) = (1,1), (2,2), (3,4), (4,2),
(5,5), (6,4), (7,5), ....
    There is a close relative to the sum of divisors and the sum of the
unitary divisors function, which complements Euler's totient function and
which is often named for Dedekind. If n = p~l p~2 ... p~k, denote by '¢( n)
the product Ilp~i-l(pi + 1), i.e., ,¢(n) = n Il(l + p-l), where the product
is taken over the distinct prime divisors of n. It is easy to see that iter-
ation of the function leads eventually to terms of the form 2a 3b where b
is fixed and a increases by one in successive terms. Given any value of b
there are infinitely many values of n which lead to such terms, for exam-
ple, '¢k(2 a3b7c) = 2aHk3b7c-k (0 :S k :S c) and '¢k(2 a3b7c) = 2a+5k- c3b
(k > c).
    That there are values of n for which the iterates of the function '¢( n) - n
are unbounded as the number of iterations tends to infinity is the subject
of te Riele's thesis (reference at B8); the least such n is 318.
    If we average '¢ with the 4>-function, ~ (¢ + ,¢), and iterate, we produce
sequences whose terms become constant whenever they are prime powers;
for example 24, ~(8+48) = 28, ~(12+48) = 30, ~(8+72) = 40, ~(16+72) =
44, ~(20+72) = 46, ~(22+72) = 47, ~(46+48) = 47, .... Charles R. Wall
gives examples where iteration leads to an unbounded sequence: start with
45, 48, ... or 50, 55, ... and continue 56, 60, 80, 88, 92, 94, 95, 96, ... ;
each term after the 35th is the double of the last but seven!
   We can also average the a- and 4>-functions, and iterate. Since ¢(n) is
always even for n > 2 and a(n) is odd when n is a square or twice a square,
we will sometimes get a noninteger value. For example, 54, 69, 70, 84, 124,
142, 143 ,144, 225~; in this case we say that the sequence fractures. It is
easy to show that (a( n) + ¢( n)) /2 = n just if n = 1 or a prime, so sequences
can become constant, for example, 60, 92, 106, 107, 107, .... Are there
sequences which increase indefinitely without fracturing?
   Of course, if we iterate the 4>-function, it eventually arrives at 1. Call
the least integer k for which ¢k (n) = 1 the class of n.

The set of least values of the classes is M = {2, 3, 5,11,17,41,83, ... }.
Shapiro conjectured that M contained only prime values, but Mills found
several composite members. If S is the union, for all k, of the members of
class k which are < 2k, then
     S = {3;5,7;11,I3,I5;I7,23,25,29,3I;4I,47,5I,53,55,59,6I;83,85, ... }
and Shapiro showed that the factors of an element of S is also in S. Catlin
showed that if m is an odd element of M, then the factors of M are in M,
and that there are finitely many primes in M just if there are finitely many
odd numbers in M. Does S contain infinitely many odd numbers? Does
M contain infinitely many odd numbers?
    Pillai showed that that the class, k = k(n), of n satisfies


                           l~:;J ~    k( n)   ~ l~:; J
and it's easy to see (look at 2a 3b ) that k(n)/ln n is dense in the interval
 [I/ln3, I/ln2]. What is the average and normal behavior of k(n)? Erdos,
Granville, Pomerance & Spiro conjecture that there is a constant a such
that the normal order of k( n) is a In n and prove this under the assumption
of the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture. They also showed that the normal
order of ¢h (n) /<ph+! (n) is hef In In In n for each positive integer h, where
'Y is Eulers constant@Euler's constant. See their paper for many unsolved
problems: for example, if a k (n) is the kth iterate of the sum of divisors func-
tion, they are unable to prove or disprove any of the following statements.
           l.       for every n > 1, a k+1 (n)/a k (n) -7 1 as k -7 00   ?
         l.        for every n > 1, ak+!(n)/ak(n) -700 as k -7 00         ?
               l.     for every n > 1, (a k (n))l/k -700 as k -7 00    ?

  l.      for every n, m > 1, there are some k, l with ak(m) = al(n)           ?
     Miriam Hausman has characterized those integers n which are solutions
of the equation n = m¢k(n); they are mainly of the form 2a 3b.
     Finucane iterated the function ¢( n) + 1 and asked: in how many steps
does one reach a prime? Also, given a prime p, what is the distribution
of the values of n whose sequences end in p? Are 5, 8, 10, 12 the only
numbers which lead to 5? And 7, 9, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24, 30 the only ones
leading to 7?

    Erdos similarly asked about the iteration of O"(n) - 1. Does it always
end on a prime, or can it grow indefinitely? In none of the cases of iteration
of O"(n) -1, of ('IjJ(n) + ¢(n)) /2, or of (¢(n) +O"(n) )/2 is he able to show that
the growth is slower than exponential. For several results and conjectures,
consult the quadruple paper cited below.

B42 Behavior of ¢(O"(n)) and O"(¢(n)).
Erdos asks us to prove that ¢(n) > ¢( n - ¢(n)) for almost all n, but that
¢(n) < ¢(n - ¢(n)) for infinitely many n.
   Ml}kowski & Schinzel prove that limsup¢(a(n))/n = 00,
                          1                                   1      1
      lim sup ¢(¢(n))/n = 2' and           liminf a(¢(n))/n ~ 2 + 234 _ 4

and they ask if a(¢(n))/n ~ ~ for all n. They point out that even
inf a(¢(n))/n > 0 is not proved, but Pomerance has since established this,
using Bruns method@Brun's method. Graeme Cohen and later Segal each
thought that he had proved the main result, but it remains open.
    John Selfridge, Fred Hoffman & Rich Schroeppel found 24 solutions of
¢(a(n)) = n, namely
       2k for k = 0,1,3,7,15,31;                        22 .3; 28 .33; 210 .3 3 .11 2;

Are there others? An infinite number?
    Golomb observes that if q > 3 and p = 2q - 1 are primes and m E
{2, 3, 8, 9, 15}, then n = pm is a solution of ¢(a(n)) = ¢(n). Undoubtedly
there are infinitely many such and undoubtedly no one will prove this in
the foreseeable future. There are other solutions, 1, 3, 15, 45, ... ; an
infinite number? He gives the solutions 1, 87, 362, 1257, 1798, 5002, 9374
to a(¢(n)) = a(n). He also notes that if p and (3 P - 1)/2 are primes (e.g.,
p = 3, 7, 13, 71, 103), then n = 3P- 1 is a solution of a(¢(n)) = ¢(a(n));
and shows that a(¢(n)) - ¢(a(n)) is both positive and negative infinitely
often and asks what is the proportion of each?
    Walter Nissen found at least 14000 solutions of a(¢(n)) = ¢(a(n)). The
twenty values < 105 are 1, 9, 225, 242, 516, 729, 3872, 13932, 14406, 17672,
18225, 20124, 21780, 29262, 29616, 45996, 65025, 76832, 92778 and 95916.

   There are numerous questions that one may ask about these two roughly
dual functions. Zhang Ming-Zhi notes that if n is prime, then it divides
¢(n) + a(n), but if n = pO with a > 1 or n = pOq with p, q distinct primes,
then this is not so. He finds 17 composite n less than 107 which divide
¢(n) + a(n): 312, 560, 588, 1400, 23760, 59400, 85632, 147492, 153720,
556160, 569328, 1590816, 2013216 and four others.

The example n = 27 shows that these numbers are not necessarily square-
free. Wilfrid Keller has continued the calculations for n :::; 335; An is prime
for n = 41, 59, 61, 105 and 160.
    If there is a value of n such that n + 1 divides An, then n + 1 will divide
Am for all m > n, and there would be only a finite number of prime values.
This problem has been answered by Miodrag Zivkovic, who has shown that
p = 3612703 divides A(n) for all n ~ p.
    There are questions if O! is included. The numbers are now even, and
only 2! -I! +O! = 2 is prime. Kevin Buzzard reported that a teenage friend
asked for which n does n divide An + (-1) n ? If S is the set of such n,
then a E S, b E S, a .1 b imply ab E S and c E S, die imply dES. So
one needs only search for prime powers. Buzzard found only 2, 4, 5, 13, 37,
463 less than 160000, and asks: is S just the set of divisors of 4454060?

B44 Sums of factorials.
D. Kurepa defined !n = O! + I! + 2! + ... + (n -I)! and asks if!n ¢ 0 mod n
for all n > 2. Slavic established this for 3 :::; n :::; 1000. The conjecture
is that (!n, n!) = 2. Wagstaff verified the conjecture for n < 50000, and
Mijajlovic and Gogic independently for n :::; 106 • Mijajlovic notes that for
Kn = !(n + 1) - 1 = I! + 2! + ... + n! we have 31Kn for n ~ 2, 91Kn for
n ~ 5 and 991Kn for n ~ 10. Wilfrid Keller has since extended this and
found no new divisibilities for Kn with n < 106 • In a 91-03-21 letter, and
a February 1998 preprint, Reg. Bond offered an as yet unpublished proof
of the conjecture.
    Miodrag Zivkovic (see ref. at B43) has shown that (54503)2 divides
!26540, so that !n is not always squarefree for n > 3.

B46 The largest prime factor of n.
Erdos denotes by P(n) the largest prime factor of n and asks if there are
infinitely many primes p such that (p - 1)/ P(p - 1) = 2k? Or = 2k ·31?
    If n > 2, then P(n), P(n+ 1), P(n+2) are all distinct. Show that each
of the six permutations of {low, medium, high} occurs infinitely often, and
that they occur with equal frequency. 2k - 2, 2k -1, 2k show that medium,
high, low occurs for infinitely many k because p(2k - 1) --t 00 as k --t 00
by a theorem of Bang (or Mahler). To see that low, medium high occurs
infinitely often, ask if p - 1, p, p + 1 works for p prime. No! Try p2 - 1,
p2, p2 + 1. Maybe. If p(p2 + 1) < p, try p4 - 1, p4, p4 + 1. Eventually, for
each prime p, there will be a value of k such that P(p2k + 1) > p.
    Selfridge settled the low, high, medium case with 2k, 2k + 1, 2k + 2 and
Tijdeman gave the following argument for medium, low, high: consider the
possibilities 2k - 1, 2k, 2k + 1; 22k - 1, 22k , 22k + 1; 24k - 1, 24k , 24k + 1;

   Mabkhout showed that P(n4 +1) 2: 137 for all n > 3; he used a classical
result of St(llrmer, quoted at DIO.

Amer. Math. Monthly, 81(1974) 405 by Harry Ruderman. In his solution
(83(1976) 288-289) Bill Velez omits (b, a - b) = (0,1) as trivial and gives
13 other solutions, (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (2,6),
(3,6), (2,12), (3,12), (4,12). Remarks by Pomerance (84(1977) 59-60) show
that results of Schinzel complete Velez's solution. The problem was also

teger? Equivalently, as Ml}kowski observes (reference at B16), for what
n = fI~=l Pr does ¢(n) divide a(n)? For example, if a(n) = 4¢(n) then
2n is either perfect or abundant, a(2n) ;::: 4n. Jud McCranie checked that
the product is not an integer for 8 < m :::; 98222287, i.e for primes P,

(primes P such that 2p + 1 is also prime) and with Cunningham chains
(A7).
    Wagstaff asked for an elementary proof (e.g., without using properties

where the product is taken over all primes. It seems very unlikely that
there is a proof which doesn't involve analytical methods. At first glance it
might appear that the fractions might cancel, but none of the numerators

This uses I: n- k = TI(l- p-k)-l and I: n- 2 = 7r 2 /6 and I: n- 4 = 7r4 /90.

B49 Smith numbers.
Albert Wilansky named Smith numbers from his brother-in-law's tele-
phone number
                     4937775 = 3·5·5·65837,
the sum of whose digits is equal to the sum of the digits of its prime
factors, and they soon caught the public fancy. Trivially, any prime is a
Smith number: so are 4, 22, 27, 58, 85, 94, 121, .... Oltikar & Wayland
gave the examples 3304(10317 - 1)/9 and 2.1045(10317 - 1)/9 and the race
to find larger and larger Smith numbers was on. Yates has given



with 10694985 decimal digits, but has since beaten his own record with a
13614513-digit Smith number.

B50 Ruth-Aaron numbers.
When Hank Aaron's 715th home run beat Babe Ruth's record of 714, Carl
Pomerance noted that 714 = 2·3·7·17 and 715 = 5·11· 13 contained the
first seven primes, and that the sums were each 29. He called n a Ruth-
Aaron number if the sum of its prime divisors, counting multiplicity, was
the same as that for n + 1. The first two dozen are 5, 8, 15, 77, 125, 714,
948,1330,1520,1862,2491,3248,4185,4191,5405, 5560, 5959,6867,8280,
8463, 10647, 12351, 14587, 16932,
     The number of them that are less than x has been shown by Pomerance
to be

Cl Goldbach's conjecture.
One of the most infamous problems is Goldbach's conjecture that every
even number greater than 4 is expressible as the sum of two odd primes.
Richstein has verified it up to 4 . 10 14 , and on 2003-10-03 I learnt that
Oliviera e Silva has extended this to 6 . 10 16 . Vinogradov proved that
every odd number greater than 3315 is the sum of three primes and Chen
Jing-Run has shown that all large enough even numbers are the sum of a
prime and the ~roduct of at most two primes. Wang & Chen have reduced
the number 335 to e114 ~ 3.23274 x 1049 under the assumption of the
generalized Riemann hypothesis.
    That every odd number greater than 5 can be expressed as p + 2q with
p, q both prime has been called Levy's conjecture. The number of such
representations is expected to be similar to that given by "Conjecture A"
of Hardy & Littlewood (cf. AI, AS): i.e., that the number, N 2 (n), of
representations of an even number n as the sum of two primes, is given
asymptotically by




where, as in AS, 2c ~ 1.3203 and the product is taken over all odd prime
divisors of n.
    Stein & Stein have calculated N 2 (n) for n < 105 and have found values
ofn for which N 2 (n) = k for all k < 1911. It is conjectured that N 2 (n) takes
all positive integer values. They also verified the conjecture for n < 108 .
Granville, van de Lune & te Riele have extended this to 2 . 10lD.
    Effinger summarizes his paper with Deshouillers, te Riele & Zinoviev as
follows:
    1. (Zinoviev) Under GRH, every odd number above 1020 is a sum of
three primes.
    2. (Effinger) If GRH holds and if n lies between 6 and 1020 , then there
exists a prime p such that n - p lies between 4 and 1.615 x 1012

                                                                            159
160                                        Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

    3. (Deshouillers & te Riele) Every even number 4 up to 1013 is a sum
of two primes.
    Kaniecki has shown, under the assumption of the Riemann hypothesis,
that every odd integer is the sum of at most 5 primes, and 'with a plausible
amount of computation this will be improved to at most 4 primes. Ramaf{~
has shown unconditionally that every sufficiently large even integer is the
sum of at most 6 primes.
    Heath-Brown & J.-C. Puchta have shown that every sufficiently large
even integer is a sum of two primes and exactly 13 powers of 2, and that
under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis 13 can be replaced by 7. The
numbers 13 & 7 replace earlier values of 1906 by Li, & 200 by Liu & Wang.
    If E(x) is the number of even integers not exceeding x which are not
the sum of two primes, then Mikawa has shown that



whenever () >     18
                  and c > o.
    Let <p(n) be Euler's totient function (B36) so that if p is prime, <p(p) =
p - 1. If the Goldbach conjecture is true, then there are, for each number
m, prime numbers p, q, such that

                                   <p(p) + <p(q) = 2m.

If we relax the condition that p and q be prime, then it should be easier
to show that there are always numbers p and q satisfying this equation.
Erdos & Leo Moser asked if this can be done.
    Antonio Filz defined a prime circle of order 2m to be a circular per-
mutation of the numbers from 1 to 2m with each adjacent pair summing
to a prime. There is essentially only one prime circle for m = 1, 2 and 3;
two for m = 4 and 48 for m = 5.
    Are there prime circles for all m? Give an asymptotic estimate of their
number.
    Similarly, Margaret Kenney proposed the prime pyramid


                                       1
                                            *   2

in which row n contains the numbers 1, 2, ... , n, begins with 1, ends with n,
and the sum of two consecutive entries is prime. How many ways are there
of arranging the numbers in row n? This problem was also proposed by

Morris Wald; the solutions given are almost certain always to work, but a
proof of this may be almost as difficult as proving the Goldbach conjecture
itself. The slightly less restricted problem in which the end numbers are
not prescribed was earlier asked by E. T. H. Wang.
    Erdos asks if there are infinitely many primes p such that every even
number ~ p - 3 can be expressed as the difference between two primes each
~ p. For example, p = 13: 10 = 13 - 3, 8 = 11 - 3, 6 = 11 - 5, 4 = 7 - 3,
2 = 5 - 3.
    Zhang Ming-Zhi asked, 15 years ago, whether, for each odd n > 1, there
were a, b > 0 with a + b = nand a2 + b2 prime.

C2 Sums of consecutive primes.
Let f (n) be the number of ways of representing n as the sum of (one or
more) consecutive primes. For example

        5 = 2 + 3 and 41 = 11 + 13 + 17 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13
so that f(5) = 2 and f(41) = 3. Leo Moser has shown that
                                 1    x
                            lim - " f(n) = In2
                           x--+co x L...J
                                     n=l

and he asks: is f(n) = 1 infinitely often? Is f(n) = k solvable for every
k? Do the numbers for which f(n) = k have a density for every k? Is
limsupf(n) = oo?
    Erdos asks if there is an infinite sequence of integers 1 < al < a2 < ...
such that f(n) the number of solutions of ai + ai+l + ... + ak = n, tends
to infinity with n. He notes that if we insist that k > i, then it is not even
known if f(n) > 0 for all but finitely many n. If ai = i, f(n) is the number
of odd divisors of n.
    Robert Silverman (W. No. Theory problem 97:10) allows powers of the
primes and asks if 33 is the largest n not representable as n = 2::J=1    p?
He also asks for the number of representations as n becomes large, and for
the behaviour of L and the aj.

C3 Lucky numbers.
Gardiner and others define lucky numbers by modifying the sieve of
Eratosthenes in the following way. From the natural numbers strike out
C. Additive Number Theory                                                   165

all even ones, leaving the odd numbers. Apart from 1, the first remaining
number is 3. Strike out every third member (those of shape 6k - 1) in the
new sequence, leaving
                 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 19, 21, 25, 27, 31, 33, ...
The next number remaining is 7. Strike out every seventh term (numbers
42k - 23, 42k - 3) in this sequence. Next 9 remains: strike out every ninth
term from what's left, and so on, until we are left with the lucky numbers

          1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 21, 25, 31, 33, 37, 43, 49, 51, 63, 67, 69,
      73, 75, 79, 87, 93, 99, 105, 111, 115, 127, 129, 133, 135, 141,
      151, 159, 163, 169, 171, 189, 193, 195, 201, 205, 211, 219, 223,
      231, ... ,

    Many questions arise concerning lucky numbers, parallel to the classical
ones asked about primes. For example, if L2 (n) is the number of solutions
of l + m = n, where n is even and land m are lucky, then Stein & Stein
find values of n such that L2 (n) = k for all k ~ 1769, and there is a
corresponding conjecture to that made in Cl.
    Hawkins discusses 'random primes', a generalization of lucky numbers,
and Heyde shows that they almost always satisfy the prime number theorem
and also the Riemann Hypothesis.

C4 Ulam numbers.
Vlam constructed increasing sequences of positive integers by starting from
arbitrary UI and U2 and continuing with those numbers which can be ex-
pressed in just one way as the sum of two distinct earlier members of the
sequence. Recaman asked some of the questions which arise in connexion
with the U-numbers (UI = 1, U2 = 2).

          1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18, 26, 28, 36, 38, 4~ 48, 53, 5~
      62, 69, 72, 77, 82, 87, 97, 99, 102, 106, 114, 126, 131, 138, 145,
      148,155,175,177,180,182,189,197,206,209,219, ...

   (1) Can the sum of two consecutive V-numbers, apart from 1+2=3, be
a V-number?
   (2) Are there infinitely many numbers



which are not the sum of two V-numbers?
   (3) (Ulam) Do the U-numbers have positive density?
   (4) Are there infinitely many pairs
                    (1,2),   (2,3),   (3,4),   (47,48),
of consecutive U-numbers?
    (5) Are there arbitrarily large gaps in the sequence of U-numbers?
    In answer to Question 1, Frank Owens noticed that U19+U20 = 62+69 =
131 = U31. In answer to Question 4, Muller calculated 20000 terms and
found no further examples. On the other hand, more than 60% of these
terms differed from another by exactly 2.
    David Zeitlin and Stefan Burr noted that the sequence of V-numbers
is complete in the sense that every positive number is expressible as the
sum of distinct members of the sequence.
    The reader is warned that the name "U-numbers" was also used by
Mahler in the theory of algebraic numbers in connexion with Alan Baker's
characterization of "S-numbers" and "T-numbers".
    Such sequences can be defined with initial values other than (1,2). Que-
neau showed that the sequences initiated by (2,5), (2,7) and (2,9) are regu-
lar in the sense that their differences are ultimately periodic. Finch proved
that if such a sequence has only finitely many even terms, then it is regular.
Schmerl & Spiegel proved that sequences starting (2, 2k +1) have just two
even terms for any k > 1.
    More generally, one can define s-additive sequences which aTe con-
structed in the same way, except that each term is the sum of two earlier
terms in exactly s ways, the U-numbers corresponding to s = 1. If s = 0
the sequence is sum-free, i.e., constructed from numbers which are not the
C. Additive Number Theory                                                     167

sum of two distinct earlier members. Compare problems C9, C14, E12,
E28, E32. More generally still there are (8, t)-additive sequences where
each term has exactly 8 representations as the sum of t distinct earlier
members. In this notation, the U-numbers are the (1,2)-sequence initi-
ated by Ul = 1, U2 = 2. Steven Finch has experimented in this area and
has a number of conjectures. For example, that the sequences initiated by
(Ul' U2) with Ul < U2 and Ul ..1 U2 contain only finitely many even terms in
the cases (a) (Ul,U2) = (2,U2) for U2 ~ 5, (b) (4,U2), (c) (5,6), (d) Ul ~ 6
and even, and (e) Ul ~ 7 odd with U2 even; but infinitely many even terms
otherwise.

C5 Sums determining members of a set.
Leo Moser asked, and Selfridge, Straus and others largely settled, to what
extent the sums of all the pairs of numbers in a set determine the set. They
show that if the cardinality is not a power of two, then the members are
168                                  Unsolved Problems in Number Theory


determined. Suppose that Yb Y2, ... , Ys are the sums Xi + Xj (i =I=- j)of the
numbers x!, X2, ••• , X2k, so that s = 2k - 1 (2 k - 1). Are there more than
two sets {Xi} which give rise to the same set {Yj}? If k = 3 there may be
three such sets, for example.


      {±1, ±9, ±15, ±19},    {±2, ±6, ±12, ±22},     {±3, ±7, ±13, ±21}

but there can't be more than three. For k > 3 the problem is open.
    The corresponding problem where sums of triples of elements of a set are
given has been settled by Boman & Linusson. The exceptions are precisely
3, 6, 27, 486. For n = 27 they give five examples of which the simplest is
{ -4, _110, 216 } and its negative, where exponents denote repetitions. For
n = 486 they give {-7, _4 56 , _1 231 , 2176 , 522 } and its negative.
    The corresponding problem for sums of four distinct elements was set-
tled by Ewell.

C6 Addition chains. Brauer chains. Hansen
chains.
An addition chain for n is a sequence 1 = ao < al < ... < aT = n
with each member after the zeroth the sum of two earlier, not necessarily
distinct, members. For example
    1, 1+1,2+2,4+2,6+2,8+6 and 1, 1+1, 2+2, 4+2, 4+4, 8+6
are addition chains for 14 of length r = 5. The minimal length of an
addition chain for n is denoted by l(n).
   The main unsolved problem is the Scholz conjecture

                                                          ?
It has been proved for n = 2a , 2a +2 b , 2a +2 b +2 c , 2a +2b +2c +2 d by Utz,
Gioia et aI, and Knuth, and demonstrated for 1 ::; n ::; 18 by Knuth and
Thurber. Brauer proved the conjecture for those n for which a shortest
chain exists which is a Brauer chain, that is one in which each member
uses the previous member as a summand. The second of the examples is
not a Brauer chain, because the term 4+4 does not use the summand 6.
Such an n is called a Brauer number. Hansen proved that there are
infinitely many non-Brauer numbers, but also that the Scholz conjecture
still holds if n has a shortest chain which is a Hansen chain, that is one
for which there is a subset H of the members such that each member of the
chain uses the largest element of H which is less than the member. The
second example is a Hansen chain, with H = {I, 2, 4, 8}. Knuth gives the
example
  1,2,4,8,16,17,32,64,128,256,512,1024,1041,2082,4164,8328,8345,12509
of a Hansen chain (H={I, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 1041,
2082, 4164, 8328, 8345}) for n = 12509 which is not a Brauer chain (32
does not use 17) and no such short Brauer chain exists for n = 12509.
    Are there non-Hansen numbers?
    It is clear that l(2n) ::; l(n) + 1. That strict inequality is possible
was shown by Knuth with l(382) = l(191) = 11. The smallest even n
with l(2n) = l(n) is 13818, given by Thurber, who also noticed the odd
adjacent pair 22453, 22455. Andrew Granville asks if there are n for which
l(4n) = l(2n) = l(n).
    D. J. Newman considers a computer which costs 1 cent to perform each
addition but nothing to perform multiplication. Then the addition chain
for n costs maximally (log n)! +0(1) instead of log n, where log is to base 2.
    An addition chain 1 = ao < al < ... < aT = n which satisfies the
additional condition that the pair (i, j) in ak = ai + aj is either such that
i = j or there is an l such that aj - ai = az is called a Lucas chain. Kutz
has shown that most n do not have Lucas chains shorter than (1 - €) log n,
where the base of the log is the golden ratio.

C7 The money-changing problem.
Given n 2: 2 integers 0 < a1 < a2 < ... < an with (a1, a2, ... , an) = 1,
then N = L~=l aixi has a solution in nonnegative integers Xi if N is large
enough. The well known coin problem of Frobenius is to determine the
greatest N = g(a1' a2, ... , an) for which there is no solution. Sylvester
showed that g(a1,a2) = (a1 -1)(a2 -1) -1 and that the number of non-
representable numbers is (a1 - 1)(a2 - 1)/2.
    Denote by 8 m (a1, a2) the sum of the mth powers of the nonrepresentable
integers. Sylvester's result is 8 o(al, a2) = (a1 - 1)(a2 - 1)/2). Brown &
Shiue evaluated 8 1 (a, b) and R!Ildseth evaluated 8m (a1' a2) for all nonneg-
ative m.
    The case n = 3 was first solved explicitly by Selmer & Beyer, using a
continued fraction algorithm. Their result was simplified by ROdseth and
later by Greenberg. No general formulas are known for n 2: 4. Roberts
found the value of 9 if the ai are in arithmetic progression.
    Upper bounds for 9 are also sought. In 1942 Brauer showed that
g(al, a2,···, an) ::; L~=l ai(di-l/di - 1) where di = (a1' a2, ... , ai). Erdos
& Graham showed that



(which is best possible if n = 2 and a2 is odd). They define




where the maximum is taken over all 0 < a1 < a2 < ... < an ::; t with
(a1' a2, ... , an) = 1. Their theorem shows that ')'(n, t) < 2t 2/n and they
proved that ')'(n, t) 2: t 2 /(n - 1) - 5t. Lewin showed that ')'(3, t) = l(t-
2)2/2J -1 and generally that g(al, a2, ... ,an) ::; l(a n-1 -1)(an - 2)/2J -1
for n 2: 3.
    In Conway's game of Sylver Coinage two players alternately mint a
sufficient number of coins of a stated denomination subject to the condition
172                                   Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

that no denomination may be minted if it can be made up from existing
coins. The player who names 1 loses. Hutchings used a strategy-stealing,
and hence non-constructive, argument to prove that a prime p ~ 5 was
a winning opening move. Almost nothing is known about the subsequent
play, and it is not known if there are other winning opening moves. If there
are any, they are 2- or 3-smooth and ~ 16.

C8 Sets with distinct sums of subsets.
The set of integers {2i : 0 :s; i :s; k}, of cardinality k + 1, has the sums of
all its 2k+! subsets distinct. Erdos has asked for the maximum number,
m, of positive integers al < a2 < ... < am :s; 2k, with all sums of subsets
distinct. With Leo Moser he showed that k + 1 :s; m < k + ~ log k + 2 where
the logarithm is to base 2. Noam Elkies improved the constant 2 on the
right to ~ log 7r < 0.826.
    Conway & Guy have given a Conway-Guy sequence, Uo = 0, Ul = 1,
un+! = 2u n - U n - r (n 2': 1) where r is the nearest integer to ffn, from
which may be derived the set of k + 2 integers

                 A = {ai = Uk+2 - Uk+2-i : 1 :s; i :s; k + 2}.

They conjecture that this set has subsets with distinct sums (established
by Mike Guy for k :s; 40 and by Fred Lunnon for n :s; 79). Several claims
of proof of the conjecture have all been found to be faulty. For k 2': 21,
Uk+2 < 2k, so that m 2': k + 2 for k 2': 21, since once a set with the desired
cardinality is found, its cardinality may be increased by doubling the size of
each member and adjoining the member 1 (or any odd number). Conway
& Guy conjecture that A gives, in essence, the best possible solution, m =
k+2, to the problem, though Lunnon defines a class of generalized Conway-
Guy sequences, some of which give a smaller limit (e.g., 0.220963) than that
of u n /2 n (~0.23512531). Erdos offered $500.00 for a proof or disproof of
m = k + 0(1) (such prizes can still be negotiated via R. L. Graham).

C9 Packing sums of pairs.
Suppose that m is the maximum number of integers 1 ~ al < a2 < ... <
am ~ n in a Sidon sequence, i.e., one in which the sums of pairs, ai + aj,
are all different. It is known that
176                                       Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

The upper bound is due to Lindstrom, improving a result of Erdos & Thran.
The lower bound is due to Singer. Erdos & Thran ask, is m = nl/2+0(1)?
Erdos offers $500 for settling this question. If there exists C such that
m < n 1/ 2 + C, then Zhang has shown that C> 10.27 and Lindstrom that
C> 13.71.
   Cameron & Erdos ask for an estimate of F(n), the number of Sidon
sequences whose members are at most n. With m as above, it is not even
known if F(n)/2m ~ 00, only that the upper limit is infinite. They believe
that F(n) < n EVn . Progress has been made by Alon and by Calkin &
Thomson, who showed that IF(n) I = O(2 n /2+ o (n»). For the corresponding
problem, modulo a prime, p, Lev & Schoen show that
                    2 L(p-2)/3 J (p_1)::::: IF(Zp)l::::: 2o.498p

    Cameron & Erdos would also like an estimate of the number of maximal
Sidon sequences (those to which n further a ::::: n can be adjoined).
    Write SF(G) for the collection of all sum-free sets of a group G. Cameron
& Erdos also conjecture that ISF(n)l, the number of sum-free subsets of
{I, 2, ... ,n}, is O(2n/2). See C9 for papers by Alon and by Calkin, who
show O(2 n /2+ o(n»), and by Lev & Schoen, who improve this to

             2L ~ J(p - 1)(1 + O(2- EP )) ::::: ISF(ZP)I ::::: 2°.498p

In April, 2003 the Cameron-Erdos conjecture was completely settled by
Ben Green.
     If {ai} continues as an infinite sequence, Erdos & Thran proved that
limsupaklk2 = 00 and gave a sequence with liminfaklk2 < 00. Ajtai,
Koml6s & Szemeredi have shown that there is such a sequence with ak <
ck 3 lInn.
     Erdos & Renyi proved that there is a sequence satisfying ak < k2+E for
which the number of solutions of ai + aj = t is ::::: c.
     Erdos notes that ~:=l a-;1/2 < c(lnx)1/2 and asks if this is best possi-
ble. He asks if it is true that
                             1                   1
                           lnx      L
                                 a;+aj:O::;x
                                               ai+ a -
                                                    J
                                                         ~O
as x ~ 00 and suggests that perhaps

                            L ---1
                              ai +a-
                                     < c1lnlnx.
                         a;+aj<x               J

It is known that it can be > C2 In In x.
    Erdos also asks if a Sidon sequence al < a2 < ... < ak can be prolonged
to a perfect difference set (see CIO), i.e.,
C. Additive Number Theory                                                   177


with the differences au - av, 1 ~ u, v ~ p + 1, u =f:. v, representing every
nonzero residue mod p2 + p + 1 exactly once?
   He could not even decide if it can be prolonged to

        al < a2 < ... < ak < ak+1 < ... < an,       an < (1 + o(1))n2,

i.e., if it can be made as dense as possible asymptotically.
     Let al < a2 < ... < an be any sequence of integers. Is it true that it
contains a Sidon subsequence ait, ... , ai", with m = (1 + o( l))n! ? Koml6s,
Sulyok & Szemeredi (see Ell) proved this with m > en!.
     If f(n) is the number of solutions of n = ai + aj, is there a sequence
with
                              limf(n)jlnn = c?
                                              °
Erdos & Tunin conjecture that if f(n) > for all sufficiently large n, or
if ak < ck 2 for all k, then limsupf(n) = 00; Erdos also offers $500 for
settling this question.
    Graham & Sloane rephrase the question in two more obviously packing
forms:
    Let va(k) [respectively v,6(k)] be the smallest v such that there is a
k-element set A = {o = al < a2 < ... < ak} of integers with the property
that the sums ai + aj for i < j [respectively i ~ j] belong to [0, v] and
represent each element of [0, v] at most once. The set A associated with v,6
is often called a B 2 -sequence (compare E28).
    They give the values of Va and v,6 displayed in Table 3 and note that
the bounds


follow from a modification of the Erdos-'lUran argument.

   Cilleruelo has shown that there is a sequence {ad, ak « k2 such that
                a;
the sums a~ + are all different.
   If g(m) is the largest integer n such that every set of integers of size m
contains a subset of size n whose pairwise sums are distinct, then Abbott

has shown that gem) > crn 1 / 2 for any constant c <       i5

large m.
    In 1956 Erdos proved the existence of a sequence S such that all suf-
ficiently large integers n are represented between Cl In nand C2 In n times
as the sum of two members of S, and more recently Erdos & Tetali have
obtained the corresponding result for the sum of k members of S.

CIO Modular difference sets and error
correcting codes.
Singer's result, mentioned in C9, is based on perfect difference sets, i.e.,
a set of residues at,a2, ... , ak+! (mod n) such that every nonzero residue
(mod n) can be expressed uniquely in the form ai - aj. For example,
{I, 2, 4} mod 7 and {I, 2, 5, 7} mod 13. Perfect difference sets can exist
only if n = k 2 + k + 1, and Singer proved that such a set exists whenever
k is a prime power. Marshall Hall has shown that numerous non-prime-
powers cannot serve as values of k and Evans & Mann that there is no
such k < 1600 that is not a prime power. It is conjectured that no perfect
difference set exists unless k is a prime power.
    Can a given finite sequence, which contains no repeated differences,
always be extended to form a perfect difference set?
    Perfect difference sets may be used to make Golomb rulers. Subtract
one from the elements of the difference set, e.g., {0,1,4,6} and take these
as marks on a ruler of length 6, which can be used to measure all the
lengths 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. More generally we may look for less than perfect
rulers of length n with k + 1 marks {O, at, ... ,ak-l, n} subject to various
conditions. E.g., (a) all (k~l) distances distinct, (b) maximum number
of distinct distances for given nand k, (c) all integer distances from 1
up to some maximum e to be measurable. We cannot satisfy all of these
conditions if k 2 4, but Leech has found examples of perfect 'jointed' rulers.

where the entries in parentheses are not necessarily best possible. There are
connexions with the graceful labelling and harmonious labelling of graphs;
see CI3 and a possibly forthcoming combinatorics volume in this series.
    Graham & Sloane exhibit the problem of difference sets as the modular
version of the packing problems of C9. They define v,(k) [respectively
va(k)] as the smallest number v such that there exists a subset A = {o =
al < a2 < ... < ad of the integers (mod v) with the property that each
r can be written in at most one way as r == ai + aj mod v with i < j
[respectively i ::; j].
    Their interest in v, is in its application to error-correcting codes.
If A(k, 2d, w) is the maximum number of binary vectors with w ones and
k - w zeros (words of length k and weight w) such that any two vectors
differ in at least 2d places, then (for d = 3)

                         A(k, 6, w)   ~ (~) / v,(k)
(and the result for general d uses sets for which all sums of d - 1 distinct
elements are distinct modulo v).
    They note that A(k, 2d, w) has been studied by Erdos & Ranani, by
Schonheim, and by Stanton, Kalbfleisch & Mullin in the context of extremal
set theory. Let D(t, k, v) be the maximum number of k-element subsets of
a v-element set S such that every t-element subset of S is contained in at
most one of the k-element subsets. Then D(t, k, v) = A(v, 2k - 2t + 2, k).
    The values of Va in Table 4 are from Baumert's Table 6.1 and those of
v, from Graham & Sloane who give the following bounds
                   k 2 - O(k) < v,(k) < k 2 + O(k 36 / 23 ),
                   k 2 - k + 1::; va(k) < k 2 + O(k 36 / 23 ).
   Equality holds on the left of the latter whenever k -1 is a prime power.

ell Three-subsets with distinct sums.
One can generalize the ideas of C9 and E28 and define a Bh-sequence to
be one in which the sums of h terms are distinct. Bose & Chowla showed
that if Ah(n) is the largest cardinality of a Bh-sequence in [1, n], then



In the opposite direction, Jia has shown that if h = 2k, then



For h = 2k - 1, Chen and Graham independently proved the bound



For h = 3 Graham obtained the further small improvement
   Martin Helm showed that no sequence containing A(n) rv an 1 / 3 terms
can be a B3-sequence.
                    A3(n) ~ (4 - 2;8)1/3 n 1 / 3(1 + 0(1)).
   In the infinite case, Erdos offers $500.00 for a proof or disproof of

                              . . Ah(n)
                              hmmf n 1/ h = 0        ?

For h = 2 this was proved by Erdos himself, and for h = 4 by Nash. The
case h = 6 was treated by Jia, and more generally Chen showed that if
h = 2k was even, then
                                              1

                        liminf Ah(n) C:n) Ii < 00

It remains an open problem to prove this when h odd.

C12 The postage stamp problem.
The covering problem which is dual to the packing problem C9 goes back
at least to Rohrbach. A popular form of it concerns the design of a set
of integer denominations of postage stamp, Ak = {aI, a2, ... , ak} with
1 = al < a2 < ... < ak to be used on envelopes with room for at most h
186                                  Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

stamps, so that all integer amounts of postage up to a given bound can be
affixed. What is the smallest integer N(h, A k ) which is not representable by
a linear combination 2:7=1 Xiai with Xi ~ 0 and2:7=1 Xi ~ h? The number
of consecutive possible amounts of postage, n(h, A k) = N(h, A k) - 1 is
called the h-range (German: h-Reichweite) of A k. In this context Ak is
called an additive basis of order h or h-basis. At first the main interest
was in the 'global' problem: Given hand k, find an extremal basis Ak
with largest possible h-range, n(h, k) = n(h, Ak) = maxA k n(h, Ak). More
recently the 'local' aspect has come more into focus: Find n(h, A k ) when
h and a particular basis Ak are given.
    The local problem is completely solved only for k = 2 and k = 3. Triv-
ially n(h, A 2) = (h + 3 - a2)a2 - 2 for h ~ a2 - 2. R0dseth developed a
general method, based on a continued fraction algorithm, for determining
n(h, A3). From this, Selmer derived explicit formulas covering (asymptot-
ically) about 99% of all A 3 .
    From the formula for n(h, A 2 ) Stohr concluded that

                        n(h, 2) = L(h2 +6h+1)/4J.

   Shallit has shown that the local problem is NP-hard.
   The global problem for k = 3 was solved by Hofmeister, who showed in
particular that, for h ~ 20,
                 n(h,3) = ~(%)3+6(%)2+Ah+B
where A and B depend on the residue of h modulo 9. Mossige showed that
                       n(h,4) ~ 2.008 (%)4 + O(h3)
and, together with Kirfel (so far unpublished) that this bound is sharp.
Kirfel has also shown that the limit
                                   . n(h,k)
                             Ck = hl~~ (h/k)k

exists for all k ~ 1. Kolsdorf showed that
                        n(h,5) ~ 3.06 (~)5 + O(h4).
   Mrose showed that



for all positive integers h - 1, h2, kl, k2 and deduced that if ki (i = 1, 2)
are fixed and



then

Thus if Xi are fixed nonnegative integers with k = L~=l iXi then




   The best general upper bound for fixed k is due to R!Ildseth:

                    n(h, k) ~
                                (k -   1)k-2 (h)k
                                 (k _ 2)!     k + O(h
                                                            k-l
                                                                  ).

   For fixed h, emphasis has been on the case h = 2. In 1937 Rohrbach
showed that



with Cl = 1 and C2 = 1.9968. After several improvements the best known
results are Cl = ~ (Mrose) and C2 = 1.9208 (Klotz). Windecker showed
that
                           4       (k)3
                                      16
                 n(3, k) ~"3 "3 + 3 "3 + O(k).
                                                 (k)2
Again, with (*), if Yi are fixed nonnegative integers with h = L~=l iYi then

                 n(h, k)   ~ (~)Y3 (~)Y2 (~)h +O(kh-1).
    Graham & Sloane (compare C9, ClO) define na(k) [respectively n,B(k)l
as the largest number n such that there is a k-element set A = {O = al <
a2 < ... < ad of the integers with the property that each r in [1, n] can
be written in at least one way as r = ai + aj with i < j [respectively
i ~ j], so that their n,B(k) is here written n(2, k - 1), and their na(k)
corresponds to the problem of two stamps of different denominations, with
a zero denomination included.
    They give the values for na(k) and n,B(k) in Table 5.

problem. Harmonious labelling of graphs.
Just as CIO was the modular version of the packing problem C9, so we can
propose the modular version of the corresponding covering problem C12.
   Graham & Sloane complete their octad of definitions with n'Y(k) [re-
spectively nc5 (k)] as the largest number n such that there is a subset
A = {o = al < a2 < ... < ak} of the residue classes modulo n with the
property that each r can be written in at least one way as r == ai+aj mod n
with i < j [respectively i :::; j].

    They call a connected graph with v vertices and e ~ v edges harmo-
nious if there is a labelling of the vertices x with distinct labels l(x) so
that when an edge xy is labelled with l(x) + l(y), the edge labels form a
complete system ofresidues (mod e). Trees (for which e = v-I) are also
called harmonious if just one vertex label is duplicated and the edge la-
bels form a complete system (mod v -1). The connexion with the present
problem is that n'Y (v) is the greatest number of edges in any harmonious
graph on v vertices.
    For example, from Table 6 we note that n'Y(5) = 9 is attained by the
set {0,1,2,4,7} so that a maximum of 9 edges can occur in a harmonious
graph on 5 vertices (Figure 6).

                     Figure 6. Maximal Harmonious Graphs.
    Graham & Sloane compare and contrast harmonious graphs with grace-
ful graphs, which will be discussed in the graph theory chapter of a later
volume in this series. A graph is graceful if, when the vertex labels are
chosen from [0, e] and the edge labels are calculated by Il(x) - l(y)l, the
latter are all distinct (i.e., take the values [1, e]).
    Trees are conjectured to be both harmonious and graceful, but these
are open questions. A cycle       enis harmonious just if n is odd, and graceful
just if n == 0 or 3 mod4. The friendship graph or windmill is harmonious
just if n "¥= 2 mod 4 and graceful just if n == 0 or 1 mod4. Fans and wheels
are both harmonious and graceful, as is the Petersen graph. The graphs of
the five Platonic solids are naturally graceful and one would expect them
to be harmonious, but this is not so for the cube or octahedron. Joseph
Gallian maintains a bibliography of graph labelling.

Maximal sum-free sets. Denote by l(n) the largest l so that if aI, a2, ... ,
an are any distinct natural numbers, one can always find l of them so that
aij + aik =I- am for 1 :::; j < k :::; l, 1 :::; m :::; n. Note that j =I- k, else the set
{ai = 2i 11:::; i :::; n} would imply that l(n) = O. A remark of Klarner shows
that l(n) > elnn. On the other hand, the set {2i + 0, ±111 < i :::; 8 + 1}
implies that l(38) < 8+3, so l(n) < ~n+3. Selfridge extends this by using
the set {(3m + t)2 m - i I - i < t < i, 1 :::; i :::; m} to show that l(m 2 ) < 2m.
Choi, using sieve methods, has further improved this to l(n) «n°.4+E.
    Neil Calkin notes the relevance of Peter Cameron's survey article and
his own thesis to Steven Finch's O-additive sequences problem (ref. at
C4). Finch has calculated 1! million terms of the sequence beginning

{3, 4, 6, 9,10, 17} and continuing with the next least integer which is not
the sum of two distinct earlier terms. He detected no regularity (ultimate
periodicity of differences) and believes that this may be due to a massive
initial segment of irregular values, while Calkin suspects that there may be
counterexamples to Finch's conjecture.
    The problem can be generalized to ask if, for every l, there is an no =
no (l) so that if n > no and aI, a2, ... , an are any n elements of a group
with no product ail ai2 = e, the unit [here iI, i2 may be equal, so there is
no ai of order 1 or 2, and no ai whose inverse is also an ail then there are
1 of the ai such that aijaik i=- am, 1 :S j < k :S l, 1 :S m :S n. This has not
even been proved for 1 = 3.

CI5 Maximal zero-sum-free sets.
Erdos & Heilbronn asked for the largest number k = k( m) of distinct
residue classes, modulo m, so that no subset has sum zero. For example,
the set
                            1, -2, 3, 4, 5, 6
shows that k(20) ~ 6, and in fact equality holds. The pattern of this
example shows that

                   k ~ l( -1 + v'8m + 9)/2J         (m > 5)
Equality holds for 5 < m ~ 24. However, Selfridge observes that if m is of
the form 2(l2 + l + 1), the set

               1, 2, ... , l - 1, l, ~m, ~m + 1, ... , ~m + l

implies that
                            k ~ 2l + 1 = v'2m - 3
In fact he conjectures that, for any even m, this set or the set with l deleted
always gives the best result. For example, k( 42) ~ 9.
    On the other hand, if p is a prime in the interval

                       ~k(k + 1) < p < ~(k + l)(k + 2)
194                                   Unsolved Problems in Number Theory


he conjectures that k(p) = k, where the set can be simply

                                 1, 2, ... , k

The case k( 43) = 8 was confirmed by Clement Lam, so k is not a monotonic
function of m.
    The only case where a better inequality is known than k ~ Ly2m - 3J
is k(25) ~ y50 - 1 = 7, as is shown by the set 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 5, 10. If m
is of the form 25l (l + 1) /2 and odd, then it is possible to improve on the set
1, -2, 3, 4, ... , but if m is of that form and even, then the construction
already given for m even is always better.
    Is k = L( -1 + y8m + 9)/2J for an infinity of values of m?
    For which values of m are there realizing sets none of whose members
are prime to m? For example, m = 12: {3,4,6,1O} or {4,6,9,1O}. Is there a
value of m for which all realizing sets are of this type?
    Erdos & Heilbronn proved that if at, a2, ... , ak, k ~ 3(6p)1/2, are

                                          °
distinct residues mod p, where p is prime, then every residue mod p can
be written in the form L~=l Eiai, Ei = or 1. They conjectured that the
same holds for k > 2JP and that this is best possible and Olsen proved
this. They further conjectured that the number, s, of distinct residues of
the form ai + aj, 1 ::; i < j ::; k, is at least min{p, 2k - 3}. Partial results
have been obtained by Mansfield, by R0dseth and by Freiman, Low &
Pitman. Dias da Silva & Hamidoune gave a complete proof of the Erdos-
Heilbronn conjecture, and in fact proved that if A h denotes the set of
all sums of h distinct elements of A, A ~ Z/pZ, IAI = k, then IAhl ~
min {p, hk - h2 + I}. Nathanson simplifies their proof and, with Ruzsa,
shows that if A, B ~ Z/pZ, IAI = k > l = IBI, then I{a + b: a E A,b E
B, a =F b}1 ~ min{p, k + l - 2}.
    One can ask the same question for members of more general groups.
For example, if A is any sequence of size g of the group G n = Zn x Zn,
and s(G n ) is the least g such that there is always a zero-sum subsequence
of A of size n, then it is easy to see that s( G n ) > 4n - 4: take the sequence
containini n - 1 copies of each of (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) and (1,1). Kemnitz
has conjectured that s(G n ) = 4n - 3 for all n. R6nyai has proved that
s( G p ) ::; 4p - 2 for all primes p and Gao obtained the corresponding result
with prime powers in place of primes. See also the paper of Thangadurai.

C16 Nonaveraging sets. Nondividing sets.
A nonaveraging set A of integers 0 :S al < a2 < ... < an :S X was defined
by Erdos & Straus by the property that no ai shall be the arithmetic mean
of any subset of A with more than one elent. Denote by f(x) the maximum
number of elements in such a set, and by g(x) the maximum number of
elements in a subset B of the integers [0, xl such that no two distinct
subsets of B have the same arithmetic mean, and by h(x) the corresponding
maximum where the subsets of B have different cardinality. Erdos & Straus
and others cited below have shown that (note that logx = (Inx)j(ln2) is
the logarithm to base 2):

            1                            1
           4 log x + 0(1) < logf(x) < 2(log x + log In x) + 0(1)
                   1
                   2 log x -1 < g(x) < log x + O(1nlnx)
and conjecture that f(x) = exp(cJlnx) = o(x E ) and that h(x) = (1 +
o( 1)) log x. The inequalities for h( x) were misprinted in the second edition.
     Erdos originally asked for the maximum number, k(x), of integers in
[0, xl so that no one divides the sum of any others. Such nondividing
sets are obviously nonaveraging, so k(x) :S f(x). Straus showed that
k(x) ;::: max{J(xj f(x)), f( .,fi)}.
     Abbott has shown that if l(n) is the largest m such that every set of n
integers contains a nonaveraging subset of size m, then l(n) > n 1 / 13 - E •

C17 The minimum overlap problem.
The minimum overlap problem. Let {ad be an arbitrary set of n
distinct integers, 1 ::; ai ::; 2n, and {b j } be the complementary set 1 ::;
bj ::; 2n, with bj =F ai· Mk is the number of solutions of ai - bj = k
( - 2n < k < 2n) and M = min maxk Mk, where the minimum is taken
over all sequences {ail. Erdos proved that M > n/4; Scherk improved
this to M > (1 - 2- 1 / 2 )n and Swierczkowski to M > (4 - y'6)n/5. Leo
Moser obtained the further improvements M > V2(n - 1)/4 and M >
V4 - V15(n - 1). In the other direction, Motzkin, Ralston & Selfridge
obtained examples to show that M < 2n/5, contrary to Erdos's conjecture
that M = ~n. Is there a number c such that M '" cn?
     The first few values of M (n) are

              n        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
              M(n)     1 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 5 5 5 6 6 6

     It's just the Law of Small Numbers that this is l5(n+3)/13J, because
Haugland proves that if there is one value no of n such that M(n) ::; tno,
then limsupM(i)/i ::; t, that 'sup' may be omitted from this statement,
and that '-1' may be omitted from Leo Moser's result. He uses a the-
orem of Swinnerton-Dyer to improve the upper bound to lim M (n) / n ::;
0.38200298812318988 ....
     Leo Moser asks the corresponding question where the cardinality of {ai}
is not n, but k, where k = l an J for some real a, 0 < a < 1.
     A closely related problem is attributed to J. Czipszer: Let Ak = {al +
k, a2 + k, ... ,an + k} where al < a2 < ... < an are arbitrary integers
and k ;::: O. Let Mk be the number of elements of Ak not in Ao and
M = minAo maxO<k::5:n M k . Czipszer proved that n/2 ::; M ::; 2n/3 and
conjectured that M = 2n/3. Katz & Schnitzer showed that M > 0.6n for
n;::: 26. Moser & Murdeshwar considered the continuous analog.

CIS The n queens problem.
What is the minimum number of Queens which can be placed on an n x n
chessboard so that every square is either occupied or attacked by a Queen?
Berge noted that, in graph theory language, this is the same as finding the
minimum externally stable set for a graph on n 2 vertices with two vertices
joined just if they are on the same rank, file or diagonal. In his notation
f3 = 5 for Queens (Figure 7a), 8 for Bishops (Figure 7b) and 12 for Knights
 (Figure 7c).

Figure 7. Minimum Covers of the Chessboard by Queens, Bishops and Knights.

    Although there is no condition that a piece may not guard another
piece, this condition is satisfied by the Queens and Bishops, but not by the
Knights. Since in Chess a piece does not attack the square that it stands
on, there are in fact two sets of problems. For example, Victor Meally notes
that, if queens are allowed to guard one another, 3 queens (at a6, c2, e4)
suffice on a 6 x 6 board, and 4 on a 7 x 7 board.
    For the Queens, Kraitchik gave the following table for an n x n board.

         Figure 8. Queens Covering n x n Boards for n = 5,6 and 11.

     If we try to partition the numbers from 1 to 2n into n pairs ai, bi so
that the 2n numbers ai ± bi fall one in each residue class modulo 2n, then
it is found to be impossible. Less restrictively, Shen & Shen asked that the
2n numbers ai ± bi be distinct. They gave examples for n = 3: 1, 5; 2, 3;
4, 6; for n = 6: 1, 10; 2, 6; 3, 9; 4, 11; 5, 8; 7, 12; and n = 8: 1, 10; 2, 14;
3, 16; 4, 11; 5, 9; 6, 12; 7, 15; 8, 13; and Selfridge showed that there was
always a solution for n 2:: 3. How many solutions are there for each n?
     If the condition bi = i (1 :S i :S n) is added, we have the reflecting
Queens problem: place n queens on an n x n chessboard so that no two
are on the same rank, file or diagonal, where, on a diagonal, we include
reflexions in a mirror in the centre of the zero column (Fig. 9).

    We can again ask for the number of solutions for each n, both in the case
where we distinguish between solutions obtained by rotation and reflexion
and where we do not.
    The classical form of the problem is to place n queens on an n by n board
with no two attacking each other, and to ask in how many ways, Q(n), can
this be done. Also to ask the same question for T(n), the number of ways
on a toroidal board: P6lya (see Ahrens, pp. 363-374) proved that T(n) > 0
just if n ..1 6. Rivin, Vardi & Zimmermann conjecture that each of

                      lim     lnT(n)             . lnQ(n)

is positive. They quote the values of Q(n) for n = 1, 2, ... , 20 as
1, 0, 0, 2, 10, 4, 40, 92, 352, 724, 2680, 14200, 73712, 365596, 2279184,

    For a modular n x n chessboard, on which each diagonal continues
on the other side, Heden showed that M(n), the maximum number of
nonattacking queens, is n, n - 1, n - 2, n - 4:::; M(n) :::; n - 2 or n - 5 :::;
M(n) :::; n - 2 according as gcd(n,6) = 1, gcd(n, 12) = 2, gcd(n,12) = 3
or 4, gcd(n, 12) = 6 or gcd(n, 12) = 12. He believes that M(n) = n - 2 in
each of the last two cases and proves that M(24) = 22.
    Mario Velucchi asks for the maximum number of unattacked squares
when n queens are placed on an n x n chessboard. He gives

  n  4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30

where, for n ~ 14, the values are described as 'probable'. He also asks the
same question, but with the number of queens not necessarily equal to the
side of the board.

C19 Is a weakly indedendent sequence the
finite union of strongly independent ones?
Selfridge calls a set of positive integers al < a2 < ... < ak independent
if ~ <;ai = 0 (where the Ci are integers, not all 0) implies that at least one
of the Ci is < -1. By using the pigeonhole principle it is easy to show that
if k positive integers are independent, then al is at least 2k-l. He offers
$10.00 for an answer to the question: is the set of k independent integers
ai = 2k - 2k- i (1:::; i :::; k) the only set with largest member less than 2k?
It is the only such set with al = 2k-l.
204                                     Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

    Call a( n infinite) sequence {ai} of positive integers weakly indepen-
dent if any relation E fiai with fi = 0 or ±1 and fi = 0 except finitely
often, implies fi = 0 for all i, and call it strongly independent if the
same is true with fi = O. ± 1, or ±2. Richard Hall asks if every weakly
independent sequence is a finite union of strongly independent sequences.

C20 Sums of squares.
One would think that the last word had long been spoken on the classical
problem of finding formulas for the number of ways of expressing an integer
as the sum of s squares. But Shimura has recently given formulas for
2 ~ s ~ 8, of which the ones for s odd are new, and Stephen Milne for
s = 4n 2 or s = 4n(n + 1). See also the paper of Chan & Chua.
    Paul 'lUntn asks for a characterization of those positive integers n which
can be expressed as the sum of four pairwise coprime squares, i.e., n =
x~ + x~ + x~ + x~ with Xi -.l Xj (1 ~ i < j ~ 4). Leech notes that at most
one of the Xi is even, so that n == 3, 4 or 7 mod 8. Similarly, numbers
n == 2 mod 3 are not so representable.
    'lUran also conjectured that all positive integers can be represented as
the sum of at most five pairwise coprime squares, but Ml}kowski (see refer-
ence at B5) notes that numbers 4k(24l+15) with k 2: 2 can't be represented
in this way. There are arbitrarily large integers that are not representable
as the sum of exactly five coprime squares, since 3n = x~ + ... + xg
implies that 3 divides two of the Xi. In fact, the product of two distinct
primes of shape 24k + 7 cannot be the sum of fewer than ten pairwise
coprime squares, and Leech asks if this is the record.
    Apart from 256 examples, the largest of which is 1167, every number
can be expressed as the sum of at most five squares of composite numbers.
    Chowla conjectures that every positive integer is the sum of at most
four elements of the set {(p2 - 1)/24} where p is prime and p 2: 5. The
smallest number which requires four such summands is 33.
    Compare these problems with some earlier results of Wright, who
showed, for example, that if >'1, ... , >'4 were given real numbers with
sum 1, then every n with a sufficiently large odd factor is expressible as
n = m~ + ... + m~ with 1m; - >'inl = o(n). He has similar results for five
or more squares, and for three squares (provided, of course, that n is not
of the form 4k(8l + 7) in this last case).
    For expression as the sum of distinct squares; if zero is allowed as one of
the squares, then I correct and clarify earlier remarks by quoting Gordon
Pall's Theorems 2 & 3, which are not as well known as they deserve.
    The only integers n > 0 not sums of four squares 2: 0 are 4 h a, where
h = 0,1,2, ... and a = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 23, 25, 27, 31, 33,

37, 43, 47, 55, 67, 73, 97, 103 or 2, 6, 10, 18, 22, 34, 58, 82.
    The only integers n > 0 not sums of five unequal squares are: 1-29,
31-38, 40-45, 47-49, 52, 53, 56, 58-61, 64, 67-69, 72, 73, 76, 77, 80, 83,
89, 92, 96, 97, 101, 104, 108, 112, 124, 128, 136, 137, 188, 224.
    If zero is not allowed, then Halter-Koch showed that every integer> 412
and not divisible by 8 is a sum of four distinct nonzero squares, and that
every odd integer> 157 is so representable. He also showed that every
integer > 245 is the sum of five distinct nonzero squares, every integer
> 333 is the sum of six such, every integer > 390 the sum of seven such,
every integer > 462 the sum of eight such, and so on, up to all > 1036
being the sum of twelve such squares. Bateman, Hildebrand & Purdy have
produced a sequel to Halter-Koch's paper.
    Stefan Porubsky used a result of Cassels to give an affirmative answer to
a question of R. E. Dressler: for each positive integer k, is every sufficiently
large positive integer the sum of distinct k-th powers of primes?
    One can also ask for every number to be expressible as the sum of as
few as possible polygonal numbers of various kinds. For example there is
GauE's famous 1796-07-10 diary entry:
                    ETPHKA!           num = l:!. + l:!. + l:!.,
i.e., every number is expressible as the sum of three triangular numbers. For
hexagonal numbers r(2r -1), the answer is the same if you allow hexagonal
numbers of negative rank, r(2r + 1), but if these are excluded, then 11 and
26 require six hexagonal numbers of positive rank to represent them. Is it
possible that every sufficiently large number is expressible as the sum of of
three such numbers? Equivalently, is every sufficiently large number 8n + 3
expressible as the sum of three squares of numbers of shape 4r - 1, with r
positive? The corresponding question for pentagonal numbers ~r(3r - 1)
is to ask if every sufficiently large number of shape 24n + 3 is expressible
as the sum of three squares of numbers of shape 6r - I?
     Schinzel and Sierpinski conjectured that there are infinitely many primes
that are sums of two consecutive squares; and hence the existence of an in-
finity of triangular numbers that are not the sum of two positive triangular
numbers.
     Michael Hirschhorn proved Gosper's conjecture that every sum of four
distinct odd squares is the sum of four distinct even squares. If n == 4 mod 8
(so that a partition into four odd squares is at least possible), the number
of partitions of n into four distinct odd squares is twice the number of
partitions into four distinct even squares minus the number of partitions
into three positive distinct even squares.
     Kaplansky & Elkies showed that every number can be written as x 2 +
y2 + z3, if z is allowed to be negative, and conjecture that there only a
finite number of exceptions to n = x 2 + y3 + z3 where y and z are now
restricted to being positive.

C21 Sums of higher powers.
Denote by 8k the largest integer that is not the sum of distinct kth powers
of positive integers. Sprague showed that 82 = 128; Graham reported
that 83 = 12758 and Lin used his method to obtain 84 = 5134240. Cam

can be expressed as the sum of three cubes of primes and a cube of P4 ,
where Pr has at most r prime factors. Kawada improved this to P3 .

D. Diophantine Equations


         "A subject which can be described briefly by saying that a great
     part of it is concerned with the discussion of the rational or inte-
     ger solutions of a polynomial equation !(Xl,X2, ... ,X n ) = 0, with
     integer coefficients. It is well known that for many centuries, no
     other topic has engaged the attention of so many mathematicians,
     both professional and amateur, or has resulted in so many published
     papers."

    This quotation from the preface of Mordell's book, Diophantine Equa-
tions, Academic Press, London, 1969, indicates that in this section we shall
have to be even more eclectic than elsewhere. If you're interested in the
subject, consult Mordell's book, which is a thoroughgoing but readable ac-
count of what is known, together with a great number of unsolved problems.
There are well-developed theories of rational points on algebraic curves, so
we mainly confine ourselves to higher dimensions, for which standard meth-
ods have not yet been developed.


Dl Sums of like powers. Euler's conjecture.
         "It has seemed to many Geometers that this theorem [Fermat's
     Last Theorem] may be generalized. Just as there do not exist two
     cubes whose sum or difference is a cube, it is certain that it is im-
     possible to exhibit three biquadrates whose sum is a biquadrate, but
     that at least four biquadrates are needed if their sum is to be a bi-
     quadrate, although no one has been able up to the present to assign
     four such biquadrates. In the same manner it would seem to be im-
     possible to exhibit four fifth powers whose sum is a fifth power, and
     similarly for higher powers."

    No advance was made on Euler's statement until 1911 when R. Norrie
assigned four such biquadrates:



Fifty-five years later Lander & Parkin gave a counter-example to Euler's

                                                                             209
210                                   Unsolved Problems in Number Theory


more general conjecture:



    It's now well known, since his discovery hit the national newspapers,
that Noam Elkies has disproved Euler's conjecture for fourth powers. The
infinite family of solutions, of which the first member is

             2682440 4 + 153656394 + 187967604 = 20615673 4 ,

comes from an elliptic curve given by u = -5/8 in the parametric solution
of x4 - y4 = z4 + t 2 given by Dem'janenko. The smallest solution,

                  958004 + 217519 4 + 414560 4 = 422481 4 ,

corresponding to u = -9/20, was subsequently found by Roger Frye. There
are infinitely many values of u which give curves of positive rank, and
further families of solutions.
      The solution of Jan Kubicek, making the sum of three cubes a cube, co-
incides with that of F. Vieta (see Dickson's History [A17J, Vol. 2, pp. 550-
551).
      Simcha Brudno asks the following questions. Is there a parametric
solution to a 5 + b5 + c5 + d 5 = e5 ? [The above solution is the only one with
e :::; 765.] Is there a parametric solution to a 4 + b4 + c4 + d4 = e 4 ? Are
there counterexamples to Euler's conjecture with powers higher than the
fifth? Is there a solution of a6 + b6 + c6 + d6 + e6 = f6? Although there
are solutions of af + ... + a~_l = bS for s = 4 and 5, there is no known
solution, even of af + ... + a~ = bS , for n ~ 6.
      Paranletric solutions are known for equal sums of equal numbers of like
powers,
                                 m        m

                                Laf = Lbf
                                i=l      i=l

with ai > 0, bi > 0, for 2 :::; s :::; 4 and m = 2 and for s = 5,6 and m = 3.
Can a numerical solution be found for s = 7 and m = 4? For s = 5, m = 2,
it is not known if there is any nontrivial solution of a 5 + b5 = c5 + d5 . Dick
Lehmer once thought that there might be a solution with a sum of about
25 decimal digits, but a search by Blair Kelly yielded no nontrivial solution
with sum:::; 1.02 x 1026 •
     Bob Scher & Ed Seidl discovered
                141325 + 2205 = 140685 + 62375 + 50275
in 1997 and recently Scott 1. Chase found
         9668 + 5398 + 81 8 = 9548 + 7258 + 481 8 + 3108 + 1588
   The "Hardy-Ramanujan number" 1729 = 13 + 123 = 93 + 103 was first
found by Bernard Frenicle de Bessy in 1657. Conway writes
D. Diophantine Equations                                                       211


          ... that 1729 is the smallest discriminant of a pair of in-
     equivalent integer-valued quadratic forms in four variables that
     represent every integer the same number of times. This was
     discovered by Schiemann, who later proved that such pairs of
     isospectral forms can't exist with three or fewer variables.
The number 1729 is also the third Carmichael number (see A13) and
Pomerance has observed that the second Carmichael number, 1105, is ex-
pressible as the sum of two squares in more ways than any smaller number.
Granville invites the reader to make a corresponding statement about the
first Carmichael number, 56l.
    But we digress. Leech, in 1957, found that

           87539319 = 1673 + 4363 = 228 3 + 4233 = 2553 + 4143

had three equal sums, and in 1991 Rosenstiel, Dardis & Rosenstiel found
that 6963472309248 had four:
   2421 3 + 190833 = 5436 3 + 189483 = 102003 + 18072 3 = 13322 3 + 166303 .

Theorem 412 in Hardy & Wright shows that the number of such sums can
be made arbitrarily large, but the least example is not known for five or
more equal sums. If negative integers are allowed, then Randall Rathbun
supplies the examples:
     6017193 = 1663 + 1133 = 1803 + 573 = 1853 - (68?
             = 209 3 - (146)3 = 246 3 - (207)3
  1412774811 = 963 3 + 8043 = 11343 - (357)3 = 11553 - (504)3
             = 12463 - (805)3 = 2115 3 - (2004? = 4746 3 - (4725)3
 11302198488 = 19263 + 16083 = 19393 + 15893 = 2268 3 - (714)3 = 2310 3 - (1008)3
             = 2492 3 - (1610)3 = 4230 3 - (4008? = 9492 3 - (9450)3
    Mordell and Mahler proved that the number of solutions of n =
x 3 + y3 can be > c(lnn)<> and Silverman has improved their value of
a from ~ to ~ and has shown that, if it is required that the pairs of
cubes are to be mutually prime, then there is a constant c such that the
number of such solutions is < cr(n) , where r(n) is the rank of the ellip-
tic curve x 3 + y3 = n. It is much harder to find these solutions. The
largest number of representations found was three, by P. Vojta in 1983:
       15170835645 = 5173 + 24683 = 7093 + 24563 = 17333 + 2152 3
but, as we predicted, this was soon beaten. Stuart Gascoigne and Duncan
Moore independently found the specimen
      1801049058342701083 = 12161023 3 + 13663533 = 116588433 + 6002593 3
                          = 12076023 3 + 34199533 = 121650033 + 922273 3

If negative integers are allowed, Rathbun gives the cubefree example

 16776487 = 2203 + 1833 = 2553 + 583 = 2563 + (_9)3 = 292 3 + (-201)3

    David Wilson, on 97-10-06, gave the smallest numbers which are sums

    If the requirement of coprimality is removed, then there are the addi-
tional specimens:

      55707778473984, 101001090159424, 169049812119552, 188013752349696,

   He defines Taxicab (k) as the least integer expressible as the sum of two
cubes in k different ways, so that Taxicab(1) = 2 = 13 + 13 , Taxicab(2) =
1729 = 93 + 103 = 13 + 123 , Taxicab(3) = 87539319 = 1673 + 4363 =
2283 +423 3 = 255 3 +414 3 , Taxicab(4) = 6963472309248 = 2421 3 +19083 3 =
54363 + 189483 = 102003 + 180723 = 133223 + 166303 and comprise sequence
A011541 in Sloane's Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. He has
found Taxicab(5) = 48988659276962496 = 387873 + 3657573 = 1078393 +
3627533 = 205292 3 + 342952 3 = 2214243 + 3365883 = 231518 3 + 3319543 .
Pending proof of minimality, Rathbun may have found Taxicab (6) by using
the first three lines of
      24153319581254312065344=28906206 3 +582162 3 =28894803 3 +3064173 3
                             = 28657487 3 + 8519281 3 = 27093208 3 + 162180683
                             = 265904523 + 174924963 = 262243663 + 182899223
                             = 564613003 - 538135363 = 491629643 - 45576680 3
Andrew Bremner has computed the rational rank of the elliptic curve
x 3 + y3 = Taxicab(n) as equal to 2,4,5,4 for n = 2,3,4,5, respectively.
     On 98-12-18 Daniel Bernstein reported that the smallest positive in-
teger that can be written in eight ways as a sum of two (not necessarily
positive) cubes is 137513849003496; and the smallest positive integer that
can be written in five ways as a sum of two cubes of coprime integers is
506433677359393.
     Euler knew that 635318657 = 1334 + 1344 = 594 + 1584 , and Leech
showed this to be the smallest example. No one knows of three such equal
sums.
     A method is known for generating parametric solutions of a4 + b4 =
c4 + d4 which will generate all published solutions from the trivial one
(.x, 1,.x, 1); it will only produce solutions of degree 6n + 1. Here, in answer
to a question of Brudno, 6n+ 1 need not be prime. Although degree 25 does
not appear, 49 does. More recently, Ajai Choudhry has found a parametric
solution of degree 25.
     Swinnerton-Dyer has a second method for generating new solutions from
old and can show that the two methods, together with the symmetries, gen-
erate all nonsingular parametric solutions, i.e., all solutions which corre-
spond to points on curves with no singular points. [A point on a curve with
homogeneous equation F(x, y, z) = 0 is singular just if ~~ = ~~ = ~~ = 0
there.] Moreover, the process is constructive in the sense that he can give
a finite procedure for finding all nonsingular solutions of given degree. All

nonsingular solutions have odd degree, and all sufficiently large odd degrees
do occur. Unfortunately, singular solutions do exist. Swinnerton-Dyer has
a process for generating them, but has no reason to believe that it gives
them all. The problem of describing them all needs completely new ideas.
Some of the singular solutions have even degree and he conjectures (and
could probably prove) that all sufficiently large even degrees occur in this
way.
    In the same sense, Andrew Bremner can find "all" parametric solutions
of a6 + b6 + e6 = d6 + e6 + f6 which also satisfy the equations

                       a 2 + ad - d 2       f2 + fe - e2
                        b2 + be - e 2       d2 + da - a 2
                       e2 + ef - f2         e2 + eb - b2

(this is not such a restriction as might at first appear). Many solutions of
a6 + b6 + e6 = d6 + e6 + f6 also satisfy a 2 + b2 + e2 = d2 + e2 + f2 and all
known simultaneous solutions (with appropriately chosen signs) of these
two equations also satisfy the previous three equations, e.g., the smallest
solution, found by Subba-Rao, (a, b, e, d, e, 1) = (3,19,22, -23, 10, -15). Is
there a counter-example? Peter Montgomery has listed 18 equal sums of
three sixth powers where the corresponding sums of squares are not equal.
The least is
                    256 + 62 6 + 1386 = 826 + 926 + 1356 .
    Bremner can also find "all" parametric solutions of a 5 + b5 + e5
d5 + e5 + f5 which also satisfy a + b + e = d + e + f and a - b = d - e.
    Tong & Cao give integer solutions of x4 + y4 = ez 4 for e = 2, 17, 82,
97,257,337,626,641, 706, 881 and show that the only other e < 1000 for
which there may be solutions are e = 226, 562, 577, 977.
    Hardin & Sloane express (a 2 + b2 + e2 + d2)3 as a sum of 23 sixth powers
of linear forms; it appears that no such 22-term identity exists.
    Bob Scher calls a sum 2::1 af = 0 (where p is prime) "perfect" if, for
any ai, there is also a unique a~ such that ai+a~ == 0 mod p. If ai == 0 mod p,
then a~ = ai. He shows that if p = 3 and m < 9 or if p = 5 and m < 7,
then every such sum is perfect.
    Randy Ekl has discovered that

              1497 + 1237 + 147 + 107 = 1467 + 1297 + 90 7 + 157

       (and     1947 + 1507 + 147 + 107 = 1927 + 1527 + 132 7 + 38 7)
        (and     354 7 + 1127 + 52 7 + 197 = 343 7 + 281 7 + 46 7 + 35 7)
in which the number of terms is one larger than the exponent. This was
also found by Bob Scher together with

               1217 +94 7 +83 7 +61 7 +57 7 +277 = 1257 +24 7
214                                      Unsolved Problems in Number Theory


More spectacular is Bob Scher's discovery



which has no more terms than the size of the exponent.
   On 97-08-11, Jim Sheen telephoned that

         1716117654 + 86748 + 98178 = 1605657654 + 115678 + 51748 .

He has a parametric solution based on Proth's identity



      There has been some interest in the simultaneous equations


                        an + bn + en          dn + en + fn
                             anbnen      =    ~en fn


For n = 2 the problem goes back at least to Bini, with partial solutions
by Dubouis and Mathieu; a neat general solution has recently been given
by John B. Kelly. Stephane Vandemergel has found 62 solutions for n = 3
and three solutions for n = 4: (29,66,124;22,93,116), (54,61,196;28,122,189)
and (19,217,657;9,511,589). He notes that if rn + sn = un + v n , then
(ru, su, v 2 ; rv, sv, u 2 ) is a solution, which shows that there are infinitely
many solutions for n :S 4. Most of his solutions are not of this form.
    There is a considerable history (see Dickson [A17J, II, Ch. 24) of the
Tarry-Escott problem, and a book by Gloden on (systems of) multigrade
equations:
                         I
                      I:i=l   ni. = I:i=l
                                       I
                                          mi. (j = 1, ... , k)
   A spectacular example, with k = 9, I = 10, is due to Letac, with
(ni; mi) =
±l2, ±11881, ±20231, ±20885, ±23738; ±436, ±11857, ±20449, ±20667, ±23750.
   Smyth has shown that this is a member of an infinite family of inde-
pendent solutions.
   Borwein, Lisonek & Percival have found two other solutions of 'size 10':
           ±71, ±131, ±308, ±180, ±307; ±99, ±l00, ±301. ± 188, ±313
           ±l8, ±245, ±331, ±471, ±508; ±103, ±189, ±366. ± 452, ±515

D2 The Fermat problem.
Fermat's Last Theorem, that the equation



is impossible in positive integers for an odd prime p, is at last indeed a
theorem. Ribet had shown that the theorem follows from the Taniyama-
Weil conjectures on elliptic curves. For as much of the proof as our margin
will hold, see B19.
     Kummer proved the theorem for all regular primes, where a prime p is
regular if it doesn't divide hp, the number of equivalence classes of ideals
in the cyclotomic field Q((p). He also showed that a prime was regular just
if it did not divide the numerators of the Bernoulli numbers B 2 , B 4 , .•• ,
B p - 3 , where
                          B        = (_l)k-l 2(2k)! 1"(2k)
                              2k              (27r)2k'"
(((2k) = I:~=l n- 2k and see AI7). Of the 78497 primes less than 106,
47627 are regular, agreeing well with their conjectured density, e- 1/ 2 • How-
ever, it has not even been proved that there are infinitely many. On the
D. Diophantine Equations                                                                  219

other hand, Jensen has proved that there are infinitely many irregular
primes. The prime p = 16843 divides B p - 3 and Richard Mcintosh, as well
as Buhler, Crandall, Ernvall & MetsankyUi., observes that this is also true
for p = 2124679.
    Some of J. M. Gandhi's subsidiary problems, mentioned in the first
edition, are covered by Wiles's method, which shows the unsolvability of
                            x p + yp + 'Y zp = 0
if P ;::: 11 and 'Y is a power of one of the primes 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23,
29,53,59, ....
    It follows from the work of Ribet via Mazur & Kamienny and Darmon
& Merel that the equation xn + yn = 2zn has no solutions for n > 2 apart
from the trivial x = y = z.
     For the equation x 3 + y3 = zt with t ;::: 4, Darmon & Granville showed
that there are finitely many primitive solutions. For t ;::: 17, Kraus gave
criteria for the nonexistence of primitive solutions and verified them for
17 :::; t :::; 9999. Bruin has shown nonexistence for t = 4 and 5.
     Here are some of Noam Elkies's near misses for a counterexample to
Fermat's theorem:
    3472073 7 + 4627011 7 = (1 + E)4710868 7 with E < 3.63615 X 10- 22
         280 10 + 305 10 = (1 - E)3161O with E < 0.00000000232
  135 + 165 = 175 + 12    Noam notes 'as it happens also 13+16=17+12'
   Elkies has also examined 'twists' ofthe Fermat equation, x 3 + y3 = nz 3 .
For n = 8837 the smallest solution is
    (94789379926733353562898641812245224156279731894522249870081533679765536690712886433241,

    The prime n = 5849 comes in a poor second, with smallest solution
    (47286187484 7622962561 798883811377209602124120625593289677386320 1 71959834,

though its smallest positive solution has values with more than 104 decimal
digits!!
    For what integers c are there integer solutions of X4 + y4 = cz 4 with
x 1- y andz > I? Leech gives a method for finding non-trivial solutions
for any z = a4 + b4 : the smallest he has found is 25 4 + 1494 = 5906 . 174 •
Bremner & Morton show that 5906 is the least integer that is the sum of
two rational fourth powers, but not the sum of two integer fourth powers.
    Prove that xn + yn = n!zn has no integer solutions with n > 2. Erdos
& Obla.th showed that x P ± yP = n! has none with p > 2, and Erdos states
that X4 + y4 = n! has no solutions with x 1- y. Indeed, even without this
last condition, Leech notes that for n > 3 there's a prime == 3 mod 4 in the
interval [n+ 1, 2n] and hence a simple (Le. not repeated) such prime divisor
of n! for n > 6, so n! is not even the sum of two squares for n > 6 (apart
from n = 0, 1, 2, the only solution is 6! = 242 + 122). [Compare D25.]

D3 Figurate numbers.
Every number is expressible as the sum of three pentagonal numbers,
!r(3r - 1), or of three hexagonal numbers, r(2r - 1). But if we restrict
ourselves to those of positive rank, r > 0, this is not true. Is it true for all
sufficiently large numbers? Equivalently, is every sufficiently large is every
sufficiently large number of shape 24k + 3 expressible as the sum of three
                                                °
squares of numbers of shape 6r - 1 with r > and is every number 8k + 3
expressible as the sum of three squares of numbers of shape 4r - 1 with
r > o?
   Richard Blecksmith & John Selfridge found six numbers among the first
million, namely
                      9, 21, 31, 43, 55 and 89,
which require five pentagonal numbers of positive rank, and two hundred
and four others, the largest of which is 33066, which require four. They
believe that they have found them all.
    Many numbers (what fraction of the whole, or are they of zero density?)
require four hexagonal numbers of positive rank; several, e.g.,

                 5,10,20,25,38,39,54,65,70,114,130, ... ,
D. Diophantine Equations                                                223

require five, and 11 and 26 require six. Which numbers require five?
   Corresponding questions can be asked for k-gonal numbers,
                          1
                          2((k-2)r-(k-4)),

with k ~ 7, in both the cases r > 0 and r unrestricted. E.g. is every number
40n + 27 expressible as the sum of three squares of shape (lOr ± 3)2?
   10 and 16 are not the sum of three heptagons. Nor is 76; are there
others?
   Chou & Deng believe that all numbers > 343867 are expressible as
the sum of four tetrahedral numbers; they have verified this for numbers
< 4.109 •
   Mordell, on p. 259 of his book, asks if the only integer solutions of

                        6y2 = (x + 1)(x 2 - X + 6)

are given by x = -1, 0, 2, 7, 15 and 74? By Theorem 1 of Mordell's
Chapter 27 there are only finitely many. The equation arises from




Andrew Bremner gave the additional solution (x, y) = (767,8672) and
showed that that is all, but the result was already given by Ljunggren
in 1971.
    Similarly, Martin Gardner took the figurate numbers: triangle, square,
tetrahedron and square pyramid; and equated them in pairs. Of the six
resulting problems, he noted that they were all solved except "triangle =
square pyramid" , which leads to the equation

                    3(2y + 1)2 = 8x 3 + 12x2 + 4x + 3.

The number of solutions is again finite. Are they all given by x = -1, 0,
1,5,6 and 85? Schinzel sends Avanesov's affirmative answer, rediscovered
by Uchiyama.
    The "triangle = tetrahedron" problem is a special case of a more general
question about equality of binomial coefficients (see B31) - the only non-
trivial examples of (~) = (r;) are (m, n) = (10,16), (22,56) and (36,120).
Are there nontrivial examples of (~) = (7) other than (10,21)?
    The case "square pyramid = square" is Lucass problem@Lucas's prob-
lem. Is x = 24, y = 70 the only nontrivial solution of the diophantine
equation
                         y2 = x(x + 1)(2x + 1)/6?
This was solved affirmatively by Watson, using elliptic functions, and by
Ljunggren, using a Bhaskara equation (often called a Pell equation) in
224                                   Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

a quadratic field. Mordell asked if there was an elementary proof, and
affirmative answers have been given by Ma, by Xu & Cao, by Anglin and
by Pinter.
     The same equation in disguise is to ask if (48,140) is the unique nontriv-
ial solution to the case "square = tetrahedron" , since the previous equation
may be written
                        (2y)2 = 2x(2x + 1)(2x + 2)/6,
though, as Peter Montgomery notes, this doesn't eliminate the possibility
of an odd square. A more modern treatment is to put 12x = X - 6,
72y = Y and note that y2 = X3 - 36X is curve 576H2 in John Cremona's
tables. The point (12,36) (which gives an odd square) serves as a generator.
There's an infinity of rational solutions, but the only nontrivial integer
solution to the original problem is given by the point (294,5040).
    More general than asking for the sum of the first n squares to be square,
we can ask for the sum of any n consecutive squares to be square. If S is
the set of n for which is possible, then it is known that S is infinite, but
has density zero, and that if n is a nonsquare member of S, then there are
infinitely many solutions for such an n. If N(x) is the number of members
of S less than x, then the best that seems to be known is that

                          cy'x < N(x) = 0 C:x).
The elements of S, 1 < n < 73, and the corresponding least values of a for
which the sum of n squares starting with a is square, are
            n   2   11    23   24    26   33    47    49   50    59
            a   3   18     7    1    25    7   539    25    7    22
    More generally still, one can ask that the sums of the squares of the
members of an arbitrary arithmetic progression should be square. K. R. S.
Sastry notes that this can occur if the number of terms in the progression
is square.
    In answer to the question: which triangular numbers are the prod-
uct of three consecutive integers, Tzanakis & de Weger gave the (only)
answers 6,120,210,990,185136 and 258474216. Unfortunately, Mohanty's
elementary proof of the same result is erroneous.
    Richard Bruce noticed that 6, 66, and 666 are all triangular numbers.
Dean Hickerson wonders if there are other examples; i.e., integers 1 ::::; d < b
such that d, d(b+l), and d(b 2 +b+l) are all triangular and answers 'Yes': If
d is triangular and b = 8d+l then it's easy to see that d(b n +bn - 1 + ... b+l)
is triangular for all n 2: O. The only other solutions (d, b) that he knows
are (6,10) and (6,2040). If we allow d ~ b, then there's also (15,2).
    For three triangular numbers in geometric progression, see D23.
    de Weger confirms that there are no nontrivial examples of (~) = (7)
apart from (10,21).

    For (~) = (7), de Weger notes that (k,l) = (3,4) is essentially exercise

9.13 in Silverman's The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves (put X = n - 1,
2Y = m 2 - 3m). The only positive solutions are                = (!) and G) =
G). The corresponding problem of making the product of two consecutive
positive integers equal to the product of three consecutive integers has just
the solutions 2 . 3 = 1 . 2 . 3 and 14 . 15 = 5 . 6 . 7. The cases (k, l) = (2,6),
(2,8), (3,6), (4,6), (4,8) also lead to elliptic curves.
    Other examples of elliptic curves were treated by Bremner & Tzanakis
who showed that there are just 26 integer points on y2 = x 3 - 7x + 10 and
they also examined y2 = x 3 - bx + c for (b, c) = (172,505), (172,820) and
(112,2320).
    There are infinitely many solutions of     m-m         = c k for k = 3. Are
there any for k = 4? And is (a, b, c) = (18,12,6) an isolated example for
k = 5?
    Pinter & de Weger note that




and give complete solutions to the (~) implied diophantine equations.

m
    Pinter shows that the only nontrivial solutions of
     = y(y - l)(y - 2)(y - 3) are (-15, -2), (16, -2), (-15,5), (16,5).
    Hajdu & Pinter survey and complete the solution of two dozen equations
of the type considered here.
    Gyory completed the solution of (~) = xl (Erdos had settled l ~ 4) by
showing that the only other solutions are with k = l = 2 or (n, k, x, l) =
(50,3,140,2).
    Luo Ming gave a simpler proof that the only nontrivial triangle which
is the square of a triangle is 36.
    Grytczuk has studied the equation




and solves some special cases. This is related to a conjecture of Erdos.

D4 Waring's problem. Sums of l kth Powers.
If all numbers are representable as the sum of l k-th powers, then it is usual
to denote the least such l by g(k). For example
 k=     2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13                 14    15     16     17
 g(k) = 4 91937731432795481079213242238384166733320366190132055
   For k > 2, with a finite number of exceptions, it is possible to represent
n as the sum of a smaller number, G (k), of k-th powers. Much less is known
about G(k): G(2) = 4, 4 ::; G(3) ::; 7, G(4) = 16, G(5) ::; 18. Probably
G(3) = 4; see the opening paragraph of D5. In 1996 Li Hong-Ze showed
that G(16) ::; 111.
    Let rk,l(n) be the number of solutions of n = L:~=l     xfin positive in-
tegers Xi. Hardy & Littlewood's Hypothesis K is that f > 0 implies that
rk,k(n) = O(n'). This is well-known for k = 2; in fact, for sufficiently large
n,
                       r2,2(n) < n(l + f) In 2/ In In n
and this does not hold if In 2 is replaced by anything smaller. Mahler
disproved the hypothesis for k = 3 by showing that r3,3 > cln 1/ 12 for
infinitely many n.
    Erdos thinks it possible that for all n, r3,3 < C2n1/12 but nothing is
known. Probably Hypothesis K fails for every k ~ 3, but also it's probable
that L:~=l (rk,k(n))2 < x1+' for sufficiently large x.
    S. Chowla proved that for k ~ 5, rk,k(n) =J 0(1) and, with Erdos, that
for every k ~ 2 and for infinitely many n,

                         rk,k > exp(ck In n/ In In n).
    Mordell proved that r3,2(n) =J 0(1) and Mahler that r3,2(n) > (In n)1/4
for infinitely many n. No nontrivial upper bound for r3,2(n) is known. Jean
Lagrange has shown that limsupr4,2(n) ~ 2 and that limsupr4,3(n) = 00.

   Another tough problem is to estimate Ak,l(X), the number of n ::; x
which are expressible as the sum of l k-th powers. Landau showed that

                       A 2,2(X) = (c + o(1))x/(Inx)1/2,
Erdos & Mahler proved that if k > 2, then A k,2 > CkX2/k, and Hooley that
A k,2> (Ck + o(1))x2/k. It seems certain that if l < k, then Ak,l > Ck,IX I/ k
and that Ak,k > x 1-, for every f, but these have not been established.
    It follows from the Chowla-Erdos result that for all k there is an nk
such that the number of solutions of nk = p3 + q3 + r3 is greater than k.
No corresponding result is known for more than three summands.
    The survey article of Vaughan & Wooley contains 162 references.
    David Wilson gave a list of smallest positive k-th powers which are a
sum of distinct smaller positive kth powers for 1 ::; k ::; 10.

D5 Sum of four cubes.
Is every number the sum of four cubes? Dem'janenko has proved this for
all numbers except possibly those of the form 9n ± 4. Richard Lukes has
found representations of all n ::; 107 as sums of four positive or negative
cubes. The only 'difficult' number was 82562; since numbers appear to get
'easier' with increasing size, it is most plausible that all numbers can be
represented as the sum of four cubes.
    More demanding is to ask if every number is the sum of four cubes with
two of them equal. In earlier editions we asked specifically if there is a
solution of 76 = x 3 + y3 + 2z 3 and on 96-01-18 J. H. E. Cohn emailed the
representation (k, x, y, z) = (76, -122171, -21167,97135) of k = x 3 + y3 +
2z 3 together with

D6 An elementary solution of x 2 = 2y4 - 1.
Ljunggren has shown that the only solutions of y2 = 2x4 - 1 in positive
integers are (1,1) and (239,13) but his proof is difficult. Mordell asks if it is
possible to find a simple or elementary proof. Whether Steiner & Tzanakis
have simplified the solution may be a matter of taste; they use the theory
of linear forms in logarithms of algebraic numbers.
    Chen Jian-Hua gives an unconventional solution.
    Ljunggren and others have made considerable investigations into equa-
tions of similar type. For references see the first edition. Cohn has consid-
ered the equation y2 = Dx4 + 1 for all D :S 400. This will have rational
solutions just when there are rational points on the curves y2 = x(x 2 - 4D)
and y2 = X(X2 + 16D), which are nonsingular provided ±D is not square.

D7 Sum of consecutive powers made a power.
Rufus Bowen conjectured that the equation



has no nontrivial solutions, and Leo Moser showed that there were none
with m ::; 101000000 and none with n odd. Zhou & Kang raised the bound
to m ::; 102000000. Van de Lune & te Riele showed that the equation is
almost never solvable. Note that n '" mln2.
   Moree corrects and generalizes a result of Carlitz and applies it to
Bowen's equation. He also shows that the equation

                      1n + 2n + ... + mn = a(m + 1t

has no integer solutions (a, m, n) with m < max(10 106 , a .1022 ), n> l.
   Iseki & Sandor find all sums of consecutive squares which are square,
where the largest square is less than 10000, and Iseki finds similar sums
from i = 0 to n of (x + 2i)2.
   Tijdeman observes that general results on the equation



do not appear to have any implications for the special equation.
   Erdos proposed the problem to prove that if m, n are integers satisfying
(K), then (1') and (M') are true, where

               (K)         ( 1 - 1- )n >->
                                        1      1)n

               (1')     1n + 2n + ... + (m - 2t < (m - 1t,
               (M')          1n +2n + ... +mn > (m+ 1t,

and that (L) and (M) are each true infinitely often, where
                 (L)           1n + 2n + ... + (m _ 1) n < m n ,
                 (M)           1n + 2n + ... + (m - It> mn.
    Van de Lune proved that (K) implies (L') and Best & te Riele proved
that (K) implies (M') and that (M) holds for at most cln x values of m :::; x.
Van de Lune & te Riele proved that (L) is true for almost all pairs (m, n).
Best & te Riele computed 33 pairs (m, n) for which (K) and (M) both hold,
the smallest being
             m= 1121626023352385,         n=777451915729368.
Are there infinitely many such pairs?
    More recently Pieter Moree, te Riele & Urbanowicz have shown that,
in the original equation, n must be divisible by 28 .3 5 .54 . 73 . 112 . 132 . 172 .
192 .23.29 .... ·197·199 and that m is not divisible by any regular prime
(see D2), nor by any irregular prime < 1000. Even more recently, Moree
points to Kellner's substantially improved result that n must be divisible
by all primes < 1000, so that n is divisible by an integer> 5.7462 x 10427 .

D9 Catalan conjecture. Difference of two
powers.
Except that there remains a finite amount of computation, Tijdeman has
settled the old conjecture of Catalan, that the only consecutive powers,
higher than the first, are 23 and 32 • We earlier said that this finite amount
of computation is far beyond computer range and will not be achieved
without some additional theoretical ideas. However, Predha Mihailescu
announced a complete proof in May 2002.
    Bennett has shown that 4 ::; N ::; k . 3k implies that




where II xII is the distance from x to the nearest integer.
    Leech asks if there are any solutions of lam-bnl < la-bl with m, n ~ 3.
With equality he notes 153 - 271 = 5 - 2 and 1133 - 371= 13 - 3. Are these
all? are the shared exponents 3, 7 significant?
    I quote from Noam Elkies's 'List of integers x, y with x < 10 18 ,
o < Ix 3 - y21 < x l / 2 ,:
            Halls conjecture@Hall's conjecture asserts that if x and y
      are positive integers such that k = x 3 - y2 is nonzero then Ikl >
      X l / 2 - 0(1). It is now recognized as a special case of the Masser-
      Oesterle abc-conjecture (see BI9). Known theoretical results
      in the direction of Hall's conjecture are far from satisfactory,
      but the question has been subject to considerable experimental
      work, starting with Hall's original paper.
            I have a new algorithm that finds all solutions of Ikl «:
      xl/2 (or indeed of Ikl «: x) with x < N in time O(Nl/2 +
      0(1)). I found 10 new cases of 0 < Ikl < xl/2, including two
      that improved on the previous record for x l / 2/Ikl, one of which
      breaks the old record by a factor of nearly 10.

   Elkies decorates the first two solutions with 'I!' and 'I' respectively:
      5853886516781223 3 -447884928428402042307918 2 = 1641843
      38115991067861271 3 -7441505802879036345061579 2 =30032270
    If al = 4, a2 = 8, a3 = 9, ... is the sequence of powers higher than the
first, Chudnovsky claims to have proved that an+l - an tends to infinity
with n. Erdos conjectures that an+l - an> dn c , but says that there is no
present hope of proof.
    Erdos asks if there are infinitely many numbers not of the form xk _ yl ,
k> 1, l > 1. Let me know if any of the following nuts from OEIS A074981
have been cracked: 6,14,34,42,50,58,62,66,70,78, 82,86,90,102,110,114,130,

    Carl Rudnick denotes by N(r) the number of positive solutions of
x4 - y4 = r, and asks if N(r) is bounded. Hansraj Gupta observes that
Hardy & Wright (p. 201) give Swinnerton-Dyer's version of Euler's para-
metric solution of x4 - y4 = u 4 - v\ which establishes that N(r) is 0, lor
2 infinitely often. For example 1334 - 594 = 1584 -134 4 = 300783360. For
an example with N(r) = 3, Zajta gives
       4011684 - 172284 = 4151374 - 248289 4 = 421296 4 - 273588 4
There can hardly be any doubt that N(r) is bounded.
    Hugh Edgar asks how many solutions (m, n) does pm_qn = 2h have, for
primes p and q and h an integer? Examples are 32 - 23 = 2°; 33 - 52 = 2\
53 - 112 = 22; 52 - 32 = 24; 34 - 72 = 25 ; are there others? Andrzej
Schinzel writes that work of Gelfond and of Rumsey & Posner implies
that the equation has only finitely many solutions. Reese Scott goes a fair
way towards settling the question. He observes that the finiteness of the
number of solutions for given (p, q, c( = 2h)) follows from a result of Pillai,
and proves that this number is often at most one, with a small number
of specifically listed exceptional cases, where it is two or possibly three.
Later, in an 02-01-15 letter, he proves that the equation at the beginning
of this paragraph has at most one solution.
    The Delaunay-Nagell theorem states that if d > 1 is cube-free, then the
equation x 3 + dy 3 = 1 has at most one nontrivial solution (x, y) and if there
is such, then x + yf/d is the fundamental unit of Q( f/d) or its square, the
latter in only finitely many cases. Adongo shows that these are just d = 19,
20,28.

DID Exponential diophantine equations.
Brenner & Foster pose the following general problem. Let {Pi} be a
finite set of primes and Ei = ±1. When can the exponential diophantine
equation L Eipfi = 0 be solved by elementary methods (e.g., by modular
arithmetic)? More exactly, given Pi,Ei, what criteria determine whether
there exists a modulus M such that the given equation is equivalent to the
congruence L Eipfi == 0 mod M? They solve many particular cases, mostly
where the Pi are four in number and less than 108. In a few cases elemen-
tary methods avail, even if two of the primes are equal, but in general they
do not. In fact, neither 3a = 1 + 2b + 2C nor 2 a + 3b = 2C + 3d can be
reduced to a single congruence. Tijdeman notes that another approach to
these purely exponential diophantine equations (which playa role in group
theory) is by Baker's method (compare F23). This makes it possible to
solve these last two equations.
     Hugh Edgar asks if there is a solution, other than 1 + 3 + 32 + 33 + 34 =
11 , of the equation 1 + q + q2 + ... + qx-l = pY with p, q odd primes and
   2

x ~ 5, y ~ 2. An important breakthrough in this area, is the paper of
Reese Scott (see D9). Scott & Styer have since shown that, given primes
P and q and positive integer h, there is at most one solution (x, y) to
pX _ qY = 2h, and, with a few listed exceptions, at most two solutions (x, y)
to Ipx ± qYI = h, and at most two solutions (x, y, z) to pX ± qY ± 2Z = O.
     The conjecture of Goormaghtigh, that the only solutions of

                             xm -1       yn_1
                             ---

withx,y> 1 and n > m > 2 are {x,y,m,n} = {5,2,3,5} and {90,2,3,13}
is still open; some results have been obtained by Le Mao-Hua, who also
shows that the equation (xm - l)/(x - 1) = yn + 1 has no solution in

     Mignotte observed that the equation n 2 = 2a + 2b + 1 is completely
solved by combining the results of Le Mao-Hua on x 2 = 4qn +4qm + 1 with
those of Tzanakis & Wolfskill, which in turn rest on those of Beukers, who
showed that x 2 + D = 2n has at most one solution unless D = 7, 23 or
2k - 1 , in which cases it has respectively 5, 2 or 2 solutions.

Dll Egyptian fractions.
Some wit has suggested that Egyptian fractions, or unit fractions, are
so called from the Hungarian for 'one', namely egy. In fact the Rhind
papyrus is amongst the oldest written mathematics that has come down to
us; it concerns the representation of rational numbers as the sum of unit
fractions,
                         mIl                     1
                         -=-+-+ ... +-
                         n    Xl    X2          Xk

    This has suggested numerous problems, many of which are unsolved,
and continues to suggest new problems, so the interest in Egyptian frac-
tions is as great as it has ever been. Our bibliography shows only a fraction
of what has been written. Bleicher has given a careful survey of the sub-
ject and draws attention to the various algorithms that have been proposed
for constructing representations of the given type: the Fibonacci-Sylvester
algorithm, Erdos's algorithm, Golomb's algorithm and two of his own, the
Farey series algorithm and the continued fraction algorithm. See also the
extensive Section 4 of the collection of problems by Erdos & Graham men-
tioned at the beginning of this volume, and the bibliography obtainable
from Paul Campbell.
    Erdos & Straus conjectured that the equation

                                   4   1    1    1
                                   -=-+-+-
                                   n X y Z
could be solved in positive integers for all n > 1. There is a good account
of the problem in Mordell's book, where it is shown that the conjecture is
true, except possibly in cases where n is congruent to 12 , 11 2 , 13 2 , 172 , 19 2
or 23 2 mod 840. Several have worked on the problem, including Bernstein,

Obllith, Rosati, Shapiro, Straus, Yamamoto and Allan Swett, who has
verified the conjecture for all n ::; 1003162753, the 51-millionth prime.
    Schinzel has observed that one can express
                          4       111
                       -  - = - +y(t)
                       at + b x(t)
                                   - +z(t)
                                       -
where x(t), y(t), z(t) are integer polynomials in t with positive leading
coefficients and a ..1 b, only if b is not a quadratic residue of a.
   Sierpinski made the corresponding conjecture concerning
                              5    1    1   1
                              - = - + - +-.
                              n    x    y   z
Palama confirmed it for all n ::; 922321 and Stewart has extended this to
n ::; 1057438801 and for all n not of the form 278468k + 1.
     Schinzel relaxed the condition that the integers x, y, z should be pos-
itive, replaced the numerators 4 and 5 by a general m and required the
truth only for n > n m . That nm may be greater than m is exemplified
ny nI8 = 23. The conjecture has been established for successively larger
values of m by Schinzel, Sierpinski, Sedlacek, Palama and Stewart & Webb,
who prove it for m < 36. Breusch and Stewart independently showed that
if min> 0 and n is odd, then min is the sum of a finite number of re-
ciprocals of odd integers. See also Graham's papers. Vaughan has shown
that if Em(N) is the number of n ::; N for which min = l/x + l/Y + liz
has no solution, then



where c depends only on m. Hofmeister & Stoll have shown that if Fm(N)
is the number of n ::; N for which min = l/x + l/Y has no solution, then



where </J(m) is Euler's totient function (B36).
     Hofmeister notes that this implies that Am (N) IN -+ 1 as N -+ 00 where
Am(N) is the number of b, 1 ::; b ::; N for which there's a representation
mlb = I/ni + I/n2, so that almost all lattice points on the line y = m,
x 2: 1 have such a representation. Paradoxically, Mittelbach lets B(N) be
the number of lattice points (a, b), 1 ::; a ::; b ::; N for which there's a
representation alb = I/ni + I/n2 and proves that B(N)I ~N(N + 1) -+ o.
I.e., almost no lattice points in the triangle (1,1), (I,N), (N,N) have a
representation for large N.
     In contrast to the result of Breusch and Stewart, the following problem,
asked by Stein, Selfridge, Graham and others, has not been solved. If
min, a rational number (n odd), is expressed as E l/xi, where the Xi
254                                 Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

are successively chosen to be the least possible odd integers which leave a
nonnegative remainder, is the sum always finite? For example,



   Kertesz checked the conjecture for 2 < m < n < 120. His most recalci-
trant fraction was 94/101 with 16 terms, the last with 4561 digits.
    Wagon noted that 3/179 produces 19 terms, the last of which has 439492
decimal digits! The sequence of numerators of remainders is somewhat
amazing: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 2, 3, 4, 1.
    David Bailey beat this with the odd greedy algorithm for 3/2879: this
halts, but the last of the 21 terms has 3018195 digits. Later, 5/5809
stumped his program; the representation has at least 22 terms and the last
has over 60000000 decimal digits. Then David Eppstein, working modulo
37943838567204570000 was able to prove that the sequence does indeed
halt, and that the numerators of the remainders are 5, 6, 7, ... , 29, 30, 1.
    Broadhurst found the example 2/24631; the numerator pattern appears
as 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ... , 25, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 1.
    Ron Hardin and Neil Sloane conjectured that for every odd number n
not a multiple of 3, one can write 3/n = l/a+ l/b+ l/e with a, b, e all odd,
positive and distinct. Note that 3/4n+1) = 1/(2n+1)+1/(4n+1)+1/(2n+
1)(4n+ 1), 3/(6n+ 1) = 1/(2n+ 1) + 1/(2n+ 1)(4n+ 1) + 1/(4n+ 1)(6n+ 1)
and 3/(18k+11) = 1/(8k+5)+1/3(8k+5)+1/3(8k+5)(18k+11). Gary
Mulkey and Thomas Hagedorn each proved the Hardin-Sloane conjecture.

    John Leech, in a 77-03-14 letter, asked what is known about sets of
unequal odd integers whose reciprocals add to 1, such as
           111111111111
           3" + 5" + '7 + 9 + 15 + 21 + 27 + 35 + 63 + 105 + 135 =
He says that you need at least nine in the set, while on the other hand
the largest denominator must be at least 105. Notice the connexion with
Sierpinski's pseudoperfect numbers (B2).
        945 = 315 + 189 + 135 + 105 + 63 + 45 + 35 + 27 + 15 + 9 + 7
Peter Shiu confirms the optimality of Leech's observations with the sets
{3,5,7,9, 11, 15,21, 135, 10395} and {3,5, 7,9,11,33,35,45,55,77,105}.
    It is known that if n is odd, then min is always expressible as a sum of
distinct odd unit fractions.
    Beeckmans answers a question of B. M. Stewart by showing that, start-
ing from !ft = ~ + ... + ~ and successively replacing fractions ~ by
X!l + X(X~l) until all fractions are distinct, is a finite process.
    Tenenbaum & Yokota show that min can be expressed as the sum of r
unit fractions each of whose denominators is at most 4n(ln n )21og2 n where
r ~ (1 + €) In n/ log2 n but that 1 + € cannot be replaced by 1 - E-
    Victor Meally ordered the rationals alb, a 1. b, between 0 and 1 by
size of a + b and of a:   !,     ~, t, ~, ~, ~, ~,£, ...    and noted that ~,

t  and 181 are the earliest members of the sequence that need 2, 3 and 4
unitary fractions to represent them. Which are the earliest that need 5?
6? 7? Stephane Vandemergel, in a 93-04-28 letter, states that ~~ requires
5 unitary fractions, and ~~ needs 6.
    Barbeau expressed 1 as the sum of the reciprocals of 101 distinct positive
integers, no one dividing another. Erdos & Graham showed that if n is
squarefree, then min can always be written as a finite sum of reciprocals of
squarefree integers each having exactly w distinct prime factors, for w ;:::: 3.
Often w can be taken as 2. For m = n = 1 at least 38 integers are required:
Allan Johnson manages it with w = 2 and the 48 numbers

Is this the smallest possible set? Richard Stong also solved this problem,
but used a larger set.
                                               i
    Erdos, in a 72-01-14 letter, sets ~ + + ... +.! = ~, where b =
[2,3, ... , n], the I.c.m. of 2,3, ... , n. He observes that '2 + 3 = 6 and
                                                          nIl           5

    i t
~ + + = ~~ are such that a ± 1 == 0 mod b and asks if this occurs again:
he conjectures not. Is a ..1 b infinitely often?
    If 2:!=11/xi = 1 with Xl < X2 < X3 < ... distinct positive integers
Erdos & Graham ask what is m(t), the min max Xi, where the minimum is
taken over all sets {xd. For example, m(3) = 6, m(4) = 12, m(12) = 30.
Is m(t) < d for some constant c? In this notation, is it possible to have
Xi+! - Xi :::; 2 for all i? Erdos conjectures that it is not and offers $10.00
for a solution.
    The value of m(12) was incorrect in the second edition. The above value
is suggested by the following table calculated by Kevin Brown:

           k              denominators of optimum expansion
        3       2   3     6

    Dan Hoey confirms the above table and gives the other optimal expan-
sions in this range as
256                                   Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

and says that there can be quite a few duplicates: there are 11 optimal
13-term expansions, 58 optimal 20-term expansions, 37 optimal 23-term
expansions, and 57 optimal 28-term expansions. He also calculated m(k)
for 13 ~ 28 as

        m(k)     33 33 35 36 40 42 48 52 52 54 55 55 56 60 63 72

    He notices that m(k) is nondecreasing so far, but doesn't see why that
should persist.
    Erdos & Graham ask if it is true that any coloring of the integers with
c colors gives a monochromatic solution of
                     1
                 "'""' - = 1,   Xl < X2 < . . .   (finite sum).
                 ~Xi

This is open even for c = 2. If the answer is affirmative, let f(c) be the
smallest integer for which every c-coloring of the integers 1 ~ t ~ f(c)
contains a monochromatic solution. Determine or estimate f(c).
   Erdos also asks that if
                111
                - + - + ... + -
                         = 1,               Xl < X2 < ... < Xk
                Xl X2 Xk

and k is fixed, what is max Xl ? If k varies, what integers can be equal to
Xk, the largest denominator? Not primes, and not several other integers;
do the excluded integers have positive density? Density 1 even? Which
integers can be Xk or Xk-l ? Which can be Xk or Xk-l or Xk-2? Is
lim inf ~ > e? It is trivial that the limit is ~ e. In fact perhaps it is
infinite. If m(k) is max(xk) for each k, then Yokota improves a result of
Erdos & Graham by proving that there is an increasing sequence of integers
k for which m(k)jk ~ (Inlnk)3. Is there a sequence of k such that m(k)jk
is bounded?
    Erdos further asks if it is true that for every solution of
                          111
                          -+-+ ... +- =1,
                          Xl X2 Xk

max(Xi+1 - Xi) ~ 3? {2,3,6} shows that> 3 is not true but perhaps
this is the only counterexample. Perhaps max(Xi+l - Xi) ~ c has only a
D. Diophantine Equations                                                  257


finite number of solutions. If the Xi are the union of r blocks of consecutive
integers, the number of solutions is finite and depends only on r. That the
             !
sequence ~ + + ~ + 413 + ... gives the max Xk as a function of r was proved
by Takenouchij see also Eppstein and Izhboldin & Kurlyandchik.
    If N(n) is the set of integers that can be written as a sum of distinct
reciprocals of integers :S n, then Yokota shows that every natural number
up to
                            Inn (1- 2lnlnn)
                             2       Inn

is in N(n), so that #N(n) ~     G+ 0(1)) In n.
    Erdos asked for an estimate for the size of the smallest integer not
in N (n), and of the largest in N (n). Croot has since shown that the
set of integers n that can be written as the sum of Egyptian fractions
each of whose denominators is bounded above by n is {I, 2, ... , lH(n)J},
or possibly {1,2, ... , lH(n)J -I} if H(n) is only slightly larger than an
integer, where H(n) is the partial sum, Ek<n 11k of the harmonic series.
    Given a sequence Xl, X2, ... of positive density, is there always a finite
subset with E 1/xik = 1 ? If Xi < ci for all i, is there such a finite subset?
Erdos again offers $10.00 for a solution. If liminfxdi < 00, he strongly
conjectures that the answer is negative and offers only $5.00 for a solution.
    Denote by N (t) the number of solutions {Xl, X2, ... , Xt} of 1 = Ell Xi
and by M(t) the number of distinct solutions Xl :S X2 :S ... :S Xt. Singmas-

                 N(t)   1   1   10    215   12231    2025462

and Erdos asked for an asymptotic formula for M(t) or N(t).
    Erdos & Joo show that for every n ~ 1 there are 2No numbers q,
1 < q < 2 such that 1 has exactly n + 1 expansions of the form E:l Eiq-i
with Ei E {O, I}.
    Graham has shown that if n > 77 we can partition n = Xl + X2 + ... + Xt
into t distinct positive integers so that E 1/xi = 1. More generally, that
for any positive rational numbers a, [3, there is an integer rea, [3), which
we will take to be the least, such that any integer greater than r can be
partitioned into distinct positive integers greater than [3, whose reciprocals
sum to a. Little is known about r( a, [3), except that unpublished work
of D. H. Lehmer shows that 77 cannot be partitioned in this way, so that
r(l, 1) = 77.
    Graham conjectures that for n sufficiently large (about 104 ?) we can
similarly partition n = x~ + x~ + ... + x; with E 1/xi = 1. We can also
ask for a decomposition n = p(xt} + P(X2) + ... + p(Xt) where p(x) is any

"reasonable" polynomial; for example x 2 + x is unreasonable since it takes
only even values.
    In answer to a question of L.-8. Hahn, is there a set of integers, each
having an immediate neighbor, the sum of whose reciprocals is an integer,
Peter Montgomery gave the examples {1,2,7,8,13,14,39,40,76,77,285,286}
and {2,3,4,5,6,7,9,1O,17,18,34,35,84,85} whose reciprocals each add to 2.
    L.-8. Hahn also asks: if the positive integers are partitioned into a finite
number of sets in any way, is there always a set such that any positive
rational number can be expressed as the sum of the reciprocals of a finite
number of distinct members of it? Here it must be possible to choose the
set, independent of the rational number. If this is not possible, then given
any rational number, can one always choose a set with this property? Now
the set can depend on the rational number.
    Nagell showed that the sum of the reciprocals of an arithmetic progres-
sion is never an integer: see also the paper of Erdos & Niven.

D12 Markoff numbers.
A diophantine equation which has excited a great deal of interest is
                                     x2   + y2 + z2 = 3xyz.
    It obviously has what Cassels has called the singular solutions, (1,1,1)
and (1,1,2) (with the usual definition, the variety has only the singular
solution (0,0,0)). All solutions can be generated from these since the equa-
tion is a quadratic in each of the variables, so one integer solution leads to
a second, and it can be shown that, apart from the singular solutions, all
solutions have distinct values of x, y and z, so that each such solution is
a neighbor of just three others (Figure 10). The numbers 1, 2, 5, 13, 29,

                                           °
34, 89, 169, 194, 233, 433, 610, 985, ... are called Markoff numbers. To
avoid trivialities, assume that < x ::; y ::; z (so that the inequalities are
strict if y ~ 2). An outstanding problem is whether every Markoff number
z defines a unique integer solution (x, y, z). There are occasional claims to
have proved that the Markoff numbers are unique in this sense, but so far
proofs appear to be fallacious.
    If M(N) is the number of triples with x ::; y ::; z ::; N, then Zagier has
shown that M(N) = C(lnN)2+0((lnN)HE) where C ~ 0.180717105, and
calculations lead him to conjecture that the nth Markoff number, m n , is
G   + O(n- I /4+ E )) AVn where A+el/v'C ~ 10.5101504. He has no results on
distinctness, but can show that the problem is equivalent to the insolvability
of a certain system of diophantine equations.

for which there are no integer solutions if a > n, and for a = n all integer
solutions can be generated from (1,1, ... ,1). For any a, 1 ::; a ::; n, there
is a finite set of solutions which generates all others. Baragar has shown
that, for any g, there are infinitely many pairs (a, n) so that the equation

requires at least 9 generators. Let M (n, N) be the number of solutions of
the Hurwitz equation with a = n and each IXil ~ N, then Baragar has
also shown that M(n, N) grows like C(InN)<>(n)+< for all € > 0 and that
M(n,N) = O((lnN)<>(n)-<, where (Zagier) a(3) = 2, but a(4) lies between

D13 The equation xXyY = zz.
Erdos asked for solutions of the equation xXyY = zZ, apart from the trivial
ones y = 1, x = z. Chao Ko found an infinity of solutions, of which the
first three are

    Did he find them all?
    Uchiyama showed that if 4xy > Z2, then there are no nontrivial so-
lutions; if 4xy = Z2, then Ko's solutions are the only ones; and for each

Q = xy / Z2 < ~, there are at most finitely many solutions, which can be
determined effectively. He gave many cases where there are no solutions.
    Claude Anderson conjectured that the equation wWxXyY = ZZ has no
solutions with 1 < w < x < y < z, but Chao Ko & Sun Qi had earlier
found an infinity of counterexamples to a generalization of the conjecture

D14 ai + bj made squares.
Leo Moser asked for integers al, a2, bj (1 ::; j ::; n) such that the 2n
numbers ai + bj are all squares. This can be achieved by making a2 - a1
a sufficiently composite number; for example a1 = 0, a2 = 22n+1, bj =
(2 2n - j _ 2j-1)2.
    John Leech observes that the extension to integers a1, a2, a3, bj
(1::; j ::; n) is also solvable for any n. We may take al, a2 to be (X±y)2; a3
can have an arbitrary value x2 + )..xy + y2, which can then be made square
by putting x = u 2 _v 2 , Y = 2uv+)..v 2 . Any values of u and v will give triads
of squares with differences in this proportion. The problem to find values of
u, v so that the scale factor is a rational square reduces to finding rational
points on an elliptic curve; arbitrarily many rational values of bj can then
be simultaneously scaled to give integers al, a2, a3, bj (1 ::; j ::; n) for any
n. A much studied case is ).. = 0, corresponding to sets of rational right-
angled triangles of equal area. We can also specialize to fix a1 = b1 = o.
Provided that a2, a3 are squares p2, q2 such that q/p has a representation
as the product of two distinct ratios (u 2 - v 2 )/2uv, then it is again an el-
liptic curve problem to find rational squares bj =        rJ
                                                         such that both p2 +       rJ

and q2 + r; are squares, and again we can rescale to find integers p, q, rj
(1 ~ j ~ n) for any n such that p2 + r; and q2 + r; are integer squares (cf.
D20). For example, 13/6 has representations (UI, VI, U2, V2) = (9,4,5,1)
and (8,5,9,1) which yield
                    02   351 2 6502 17282 32002
                   7202 801 2 9702 18722 32802
                   15602 15992 16902 23282 35602
   More generally we seek integers ai (1 ~ i ~ m), bj (1 ~ j ~ n). Jean
Lagrange has produced the matrix
    (54,150,111)2      (56,150,79)2     (72,234, 177)2    (72, 186,57)2]

of squares of quadratic forms, (a, b, c) = au 2 + buv + cv 2 , which yields an
infinity of solutions with m = n = 4. For example, U = 2, V = 1 gives

In these examples, the ai, bj are not squares. If the ai, bj are them-
selves squares, then they provide configurations relevant to D20 (which
see) where Lagrange & Leech have made considerable progress. Their triad
and tetrad of squares a~ (i = 1,2,3) and bJ (j = 1,2,3,4) with all a~ + bJ

DI5 Numbers whose sums in pairs make
squares.
Erdos & Leo Moser (and see earlier references) also asked the analogous
question: are there, for every n, n distinct numbers such that the sum of
any pair is a square? For n = 3 we can take
    al = ~(q2 + r2 _ p2)   a2 = ~(r2 + p2 _ q2) a3 = ~(p2 + q2 _ r2)
and for n = 4 we may augment these by taking s to be any number ex-
pressible as the sum of two squares in three distinct ways
      s = u 2 + p2 = v 2 + q2 = w 2 + r2 and a4 = s _ ~(p2 + q2 _ r2).
   Jean Lagrange has given a quite general parametric solution for n = 5
and a simplification of it which appears to give a majority of all solutions.
He tabulates the first 80 solutions, calculated by J.-L. Nicolas. The smallest
is
                    -4878 4978 6903 12978 31122
and the smallest positive solution (at most one number can be negative) is

                 7442   28658    148583    177458   763442.

In a letter dated 72-05-19 he sends the following solution for n = 6:

  -15863902     17798783 21126338         49064546 82221218 447422978

    In fact the problem goes back to T. Baker who found five integers whose
sums in pairs were squares, and C. Gill who found five whose sums in threes
were squares.
                1917678, 2052219, 4152603, -1981797, 70203
which yield the squares of 2850, 1410, 2010, 2022, 2478, 78, 2055, 2505,
375 and 1497. He suggested that it ought to be possible, using his method
of trigonometric functions, to find 5 positive integers with this property
"but the complexity of the formulas do not encourage the attempt, and
the object seems unworthy of the effort." With modern equipment Wagon
was able to make the effort. His first results involved 48- and 49-digit
numbers, but he later discovered the quintuple

              186378732807587076747,519650114814905002347
whose sums in threes are squares. What is the smallest solution?
    Diophantus, V, 17, gave a method to divide a given number into four
parts such that the sum of any three of the parts is a (rational) square.
Kausler extended this to n parts, the sum of any n - 1 a square.
    Lagrange also found sets of n squares of which any n - 1 have their
sum square. For n = 3, 5 and 8, the smallest such are the squares of
(44,117,240), (28,64,259,392,680) and(79,112,204,632,896,916,1828,2092).

    Martin LaBar asked for a proof or disproof that a 3 x 3 magic square
can be constructed from nine distinct integer squares. This requires that
the nine quantities x 2, y2, z2, y2 + z2 _ x 2, Z2 + x 2 _ y2, x 2 + y2 _ z2,
2X2 - y2, 2x2 - z2, 3x 2 - y2 - z2 be distinct perfect squares; John Robertson
showed that this is equivalent to the existence of three points, doubles of
those of other points in the group law, whose x-coordinates are in A.P., on
a 'congruent number' type (see D27) elliptic curve.
    Duncan Buell searched for a 'magic hour-glass'
                              a-b       a+b+c        a-c
                                            a
                              a+c       a-b-e        a+b
with all seven entries squares, but found none with a < 25 . 1024 .
   Bremner found a magic square with seven square entries :
                                3732      289 2    565 2
                               360721     425 2     23 2
                                205 2     5272    222121
    Michael Schweitzer showed that any such square must have entries with
at least 9 decimal digits. He gives the following specimens in which only
one diagonal fails:




      The magic totals are squares in each case: 1472 , 294 2 , 441 2 . Does this
have to happen?
      Andrew Bremner gave the following parametric family of magic squares
with seven of the eight sums equal.
      {{a, b, e}, {d, e, J}, {g, h, i} } is the notation for the square which has the
three rows {a, b, e}, {d, e, J} and {g, h, i}. Only the principal diagonal fails.
For it to be truly magic, t must be a root of a computable polynomial of
degree 34.

   It's implicit in the work of Carmichael that there can be no 3 x 3 magic
square with entries which are cubes or are fourth powers.
   Magic squares continue to fascinate both amateurs and professionals.
The following example, due to David Collison, is 'trimagic' in the sense
that it is magic and stays so when you either square or cube the entries.

    Has anyone constructed a 5 x 5 x 5 magic cube, or proved its impossi-
bility? Rich Schroeppel notes that the centre cell of a magic 95 is always
the average cell value, and that a corollary is that there is no magic 96 .

D16 Triples with the same sum and same
product.

The problem to find as many different triples of positive integers as possible
with the same sum and the same product has been solved by Schinzel: you
can have arbitrarily many. In the interim Stephane Vandemergel found 13
triples each with sum 17116 and product 21033 52 72 11 . 13·19. It may be
of interest to ask for the smallest sums or products with each multiplicity.
For example, for 4 triples, J. G. Mauldon finds the smallest common sum
to be 118: (14,50,54), (15,40,63), (18,30,70), (21,25,72) and the smallest
common product to be 25200: (6,56,75), (7,40,90), (9,28,100), (12,20,105).
     Schinzel's solution is derived from points on the elliptic curve y2 =
x 3 - 9x + 9 (324C1 in Cremona, rank 1, generator (1,1), inflexion points

D17 Product of blocks of consecutive integers
not a power.
Erdos & Selfridge have proved that the product of consecutive integers
is never a power, and the binomial coefficient (~) (see B31) is never a
power for n ~ 2k ~ 8. If k = 2, then (~) is a square infinitely often,
but Tijdeman's methods (see D9) will probably show that it is never a
nontrivial higher power (for cubes and fourth powers, see Mordell's book),
and that k = 3 never gives a power, apart from n = 50 (see D3).
    Erdos & Graham ask if the product of two or more disjoint blocks of
consecutive integers can be a power. Pomerance has noted that
                              I1;=1 (ai - l)ai(ai + 1)
is a square if al = 2n - 1 , a2 = 2n , a3 = 22n - 1 - 1, a4 = 22n - 1, but Erdos
& Graham suggest that if l ~ 4, then I17=1 I1~=1 (ai + j) is a square on
only a finite number of occasions.
    K. R. S. Sastry notes that the product of the blocks (n -1 )n(n + 1) and
(2n - 2)(2n -1)2n is a square if (n+ 1)(2n -1) = m 2 • This is equivalent to
a Bhaskara equation (aka Pell equation) with an infinity of solutions. E.g.
n = 74 gives

                (73 . 74 . 75)(146 . 147· 148) = 732 .742 .2102

    Erdos also asks ifthe product of (more than one) consecutive odd num-
bers is never a power (higher than the first)? Is the product of 4 consecu-
tive members of an A.P. never a power? Euler showed that it cannot be a
square. Fermat had shown that the members cannot be squares individu-
ally, while a nonsquare divisor must divide two distinct terms, either (a) 2
divides the first & third or the second & fourth, or (b) 3 divides the first
& fourth, or both. (a) alone is impossible mod 8, (b) alone is impossible
mod 3, but we could have 6t 2 , u 2 , 2v 2 , 3w 2 . But this implies w 2 + t 2 = v 2
and w 2 + 4t 2 = u 2 , which can be disproved by descent - one Pythagorean
ratio can't be twice another. For higher powers Leech notes that we can't
have three cubes in A.P.
    Sastry asks for which k can the product of four consecutive terms
of an A.P. be a k-gonal number, where the r-th k-gonal number is
                            !r«k - 2)r - (k - 4)).
Not for k = 4, as Euler showed, but Sastry finds solutions for all other k
except 7, 14 and 37. Are these impossible?
    Saradha, Shorey & Tijdeman show that, apart from

       (k+1)(k+2)···(2k)=2·6···(4k-2)                 for   k=2,3,4, ... ,

there are only finitely many A.P.s with given differences of equal lengths
~ 2 and with equal products.

    Bennett, Gyory & Hajdu show that the product of consecutive members
of a k-term A.P. is not a power for 4 :S k :S 11, except in cases where there
is a common factor, as in 9·18·27·36 = 543 .
    In a 93-05-07 letter to Ron Graham, Nobuhisa Abe states that
x(x + 1) ... (x + k) = y2 -1 has the unique solution (x,y) = (2,71) for
k = 5 and no solutions for k = 7 or 11. Akos Pinter has a method for
dealing with the equation when k is odd.

DIS Is there a perfect cuboid? Four squares
whose sums in pairs are square. Four squares
whose differences are square.
Is there a rational box? Our treatment of this notorious unsolved problem
is owed almost entirely to John Leech. Does there exist a perfect cuboid,
with integer edges Xi, face diagonals Yi and body diagonal Z; are there
solutions of the simultaneous diophantine equations

 (A)

(B)                                           ?

(i = 1, 2, 3; and where necessary, subscripts are reduced modulo 3.)
    Martin Gardner asked if any six of Xi, Yi, z could be integers. Here
there are three problems: just the body diagonal z irrational; just one edge
X3 irrational; just one face diagonal YI irrational.
    Problem 1. We require solutions to the three equations (A). Suppose
such solutions have generators ai, bi where

                xi+l : Xi+2 : Yi = 2ai bi .·a~-b~·
                                            .   •.•a~+b2•

Then we want integer solutions of

(C)

We can assume that the generator pairs have opposite parity and replace
(C) by

(D)

An example is
                         62 _ 52 112 _ 22
(E)
                         2·6·5 2·11·2
Kraitchik gave 241 + 18 - 2 cuboids with odd edge less than a million. Lal
& Blundon listed all cuboids obtainable from (D) with aI, bl ; a, (3 ::; 70,
including the curious pair (1008,1100,1155), (1008,1100,12075). Leech
has deposited a list of all solutions of (D) with two pairs of aI, bl ; a2, b2;
a, (3 ::; 376.
    Reversal of the cyclic order of subscripts in (C) leads to the derived
cuboid: example (E) gives the least solution (240,44,117), known to Euler,
276                                       Unsolved Problems in Number Theory


and the derived cuboid (429,2340,880). Note that 240·429 = 44·2340 =
117·880.
   Several parametric solutions are known: the simplest, also known to
Euler, is

(F)                                     al = 4pq,

For aI, bl fixed, (D) is equivalent to the plane cubic curve

                          a~ - b~    u2 - 1 2v
                           2a l bl = ~ . v 2 - 1

whose rational points are finitely generated, so Mordell tells us that one
solution leads to an infinity. But not all rationals aI/b l occur in solutions:
aI/b l = 2 is impossible, so there is no rational cuboid with a pair of edges
in the ratio 3:4.
    Problem 2. Just an edge irrational. We want x~ + x~ = Y~ with
t + x~, t + x~, t + Y~ all squares. This was proposed by "Mahatma" and
readers gave Xl = 124, X2 = 957, t = 13852800. Bromhead extended this
to a parametric solution. An infinity of solutions is given by

(G)

where (~, 1], () is a Pythagorean triple. The simplest such is ~ = 5, 1] = 12;
Xl = 7800, X2 = 18720; t = 211773121. An earlier solution was given by
Flood.
   These are not all. We seek solutions of

(H)

other than z      Y3 (t = 0). Leech found 100 primitive solutions with
z < 105 , 46 of which had t > O. The generators for (H) satisfy

                         Q~ + f3r       2Q2f32       a 2 - b2
(I)
                          2Qlf31 Q +.    2
                                         2
                                               2 -
                                             f32       2ab

so solutions for fixed X2/XI correspond to rational points on the cubic curve

(J)

The trivial solution t = 0 corresponds to several ordinary points which
generate an infinity of solutions for each ratio X2/XI. Solutions form cycles
of four
        (2 = ~f + 1]f = ~~ + 1]~ = ~~ + 1]~ = ~l + 1]l,      66 = 6~4'
(K)
              ~f + ~~, ~~ + ~~, ~~ + ~l, ~l + ~f        all squares,
corresponding to two pairs X2/Xl which correspond to two points collinear
D. Diophantine Equations                                                      277


with the point t = 0 on (J). Conversely, such a pair of points corresponds
to a cycle of four solutions.
    Problem 3. Just one face diagonal irrational. There are two closely
related problems: find three integers whose sums and differences are all
squares; find three squares whose differences are squares. The cuboid form
of the problem asks for integers satisfying

(L)

whose generators satisfy

                         a~ - /3~ a~ - /3~
(M)
                          2a1/31    2a3/33

Write Ui = (a~ - /3'1)2 /4a~/3l and (M) becomes U1U3 = 1 +U2, an equation
investigated by many in the contexts of cycles and frieze patterns. So-
lutions occur in cycles of five! Leech listed 35 such with aI, /31, a2, /32 :::; 50
and deposited in UMT a list of all cycles with two pairs ai, /3i :::; 376.
There is a close connexion with Napier's rules and the construction of ra-
tional spherical triangles.
    Solutions to (L) are given by x~ = Z2 - y~ = (p2 - q2)(r2 - s2),
x~ = z2 - y~ = 4pqrs, when the products of the numerators and denomi-
nators of (P2 - q2)/2pq and (r2 - s2)/2rs are each squares. Euler made p,
q, r, s squares and found differences of fourth powers, e.g., 34 - 24 , 94 - 74 ,
114 - 24 , whose products in pairs are squares. The first two give the sec-
ond smallest solution (117,520,756) of this type, whose cycle includes the
smallest (104,153,672), also known to Euler.
    We can also express Z2 = x~ + y~ = x~ + y~ as the sum of two squares in
two different ways: X3/X1 = (a~-/3~)/2a2/32' X2/X1 = (a~-/3~)/2a3/33 give
z2 = 4(a~a~ + /3~/3~)(a~/3~ + a~/3~). Euler made each factor square and
found two rational right triangles of equal area !a2a3/32/33. Diophantus
solved this with /32/a2 = (s + t)/2r, /33/a3 = sit, where r2 = s2 + st + t 2,
S = l2 - m 2, t = m 2 - n 2. Put (l,m,n) = (1,2, -3) and we have a cycle
containing the third, fourth and fifth smallest of these cuboids. Leech found
89 with z < 105 .
    For fixed ad /31 a nontrivial solution to (M) corresponds to an ordinary
point, which generates an infinity of solutions, on the curve



The tangent at the point generates a cycle of special interest.
    (M), like (D), but unlike (I), does not have nontrivial solutions for all
ratios a/ /3; e.g., there are none with a/ /3 = 2 or 3 and again no cuboids
with edges in the ratio 3:4. Here we do not have "derived" cuboids.
278                                  Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

   Two other parametric forms for ratios (p2 - q2)/2pq whose product and
quotient are squares, are




    Four squares whose sums in pairs are square. A solution of (C)
gives three such squares; it may be portrayed as a trivalent vertex of a
graph, the three edges joining it to nodes representing generator pairs
for rational triangles. If such a pair occurs in one solution it occurs in
infinitely many, so the valence of a node is infinite. We seek a subgraph
homeomorphic to a tetrahedron K4 whose vertices give four solutions of (C)
and whose edges contain nodes corresponding to generator pairs common to
pairs of solutions of (C). Lists of solutions have revealed no such subgraph;
indeed, not even a closed circuit! Until a circuit is encountered, we need
not distinguish between the pairs a, b and a ± b.

   So no example of four such squares is known. Construction of four
squares with five square sums of pairs is straightforward.

   A. R. Thatcher related the problem to the equation y2 = -x8 + 35x4 -
25. The only integer solutions are (±1, ±3), but there may be a finite
number of other rational solutions. Even if not, this does not preclude
solutions to the original problem.

    Four squares whose differences are square. This problem extends
(M) analogously to the above extension of (C). A vertex is now pentavalent,
adjacent to a cycle of five nodes or generator pairs. The cyclic order of the
edges is important, but not the sense of rotation. A solution of (M) corre-
sponds to three consecutive edges, and here we must distinguish between
a, /3 and a ± /3: the corresponding nodes are joined with double edges in
Figure 11. The nodes are again of infinite valence. Four squares of the
req~ired type would correspond to a subgraph homeomorphic to K 6 , with
six ~rtices and 15 nodes, one on each edge. The only cycle so far found
is sho\rn in Figure 11 and this will not serve as part of such a subgraph.
Although a solution is unlikely, there do not appear to be any congruence
conditions which forbid it.

   Though there is now no necessary connexion between the generator
pairs 0:, (3 and 0:±(3, solutions of (M) containing both pairs do occur. Such
a solution leads to a sequence of four squares with sums of two or three
consecutive terms all square. How long can such a sequence be? For more
than four we need a sequence of 5-cycles of solutions of (M) each containing
adjacent generator pairs 0:, (3; a, iJ where 0: ± (3, a ± iJ belong one each to
the neighboring cycles. Leech found the sequence
(56,31)(17,6);(23,11)(23,7);(15,8)(26,7);(33,19)(77,19);(48,29)(35,4);(39,31)(13,9)
where 23, 11 = 17±6, etc., which gives a sequence of eight such squares. The
squares of the edges of a perfect cuboid would form an infinite (periodic)
sequence. Four nonzero squares with differences all square would lead to a
sequence with terms three apart in constant ratio: an integer ratio would
give an infinite sequence. Leech has since given the longer sequence
(14,1)(224,37); (261,187)(155,132); (287,23)(23,7);
                (15,8)(26,7); (33,19)(77,19); (48,29)(35,4); (39,31)(13,9)
with "both ends surprisingly small" and asks "are they really ends?" He
has no proof that a pair (a, b) can occur while (a + b, a - b) does not. He has
some other sequences of the same length, but so far none longer. Randall
Rathbun was unable to extend this sequence before (14,1) or after (13,9),
but he was able to extend the earlier sequence to seven terms by prefixing
(26767,2185)(87,25); or (940,693)(87,25); before (56,31).

    The perfect rational cuboid. None of the known numerical solu-
tions to problems 1, 2 and 3 gives a perfect cuboid, and many parametric
solutions, for example (G), can be shown not to yield one. Spohn used
Pocklington's work to show that one of the two mutually derived cuboids
of (F) is not perfect and E. Z. Chein and Jean Lagrange have each shown
that the derived cuboid is never perfect. On the other hand, no known
parametric solution is complete so impossibility can't be proved from these
alone. A solution of the problem in the previous section need not lead to
a perfect cuboid. Korec showed that the least edge of a perfect rational
cuboid must exceed 106 • Extensive searches, mainly by Randall Rathbun
and Torbjorn Granlund, have shown that a perfect rational cuboid must
have all its edges greater than 333750000. During the search, the results of
which have been deposited in UMT, 6800 + 6380 + 6749 solutions of the
three problems were found. Recently Korec has shown that the greatest
edge is greater than 109 • Leech amplifies a result of Horst Bergmann to
show that the product of the edges, face diagonals and body diagonal must
be divisible by

              28 X 34 X 53 X 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 29 x 37

and Dale Shoults notes that the power of 5 can be raised to 54,

    Unsolved problems. Do three cycles of solutions of (M) exist whose
graph is as in Figure 12? Here we've adopted John Leech's convention of
writing the ratio of the edges as a fraction, e.g. 1l!.,
                                                   Xl
                                                         where the same pair
of generators belongs to both cycles (as the pair 14, 3 in Figure 11), but
writing it as a ratio, e.g. X2 : X3, where a pair of generators belongs to
one cycle, and their sum and difference to the other (as 15, 8 and 23, 7 in
Figure 11).
    Are there ratios (p2 - q2)/2pq, (r2 + s2)/2rs with product and quotient
both of the form (m 2 - n 2 )/2mn? Is there a nontrivial solution of
                (a 2c2 _ b2d2)(a2d2 _ b2c2) = (a 2b2 _ c2d2)2?

Such a solution would lead to a perfect cuboid. Is there a 5-cycle of solutions
of (M) with

             o.d/31 = (p2 - q2)/2pq,     0.2//32 = (r2 + s2)/2rs?

What circuits, if any, occur in the graph of solutions of (C)? What circuits
occur in the graph of solutions of (M)? Are there cycles of solutions of
(I) other than those of form (K)? What ratios besides 3/4 cannot occur
as ratios of edges of cuboids in Problem I? In Problem 3? Is there a
parallelepiped with all edges, face diagonals and body diagonals rational?
Rathbun has found 41 pairs of primitive cuboids in which two edges of
one equal two of the other. Twenty-one of these are pairs of solutions to
D. Diophantine Equations                                                   281


Problem 1, with the body diagonal irrational; 13 are pairs of solutions to
Problem 2; three are pairs of solutions to Problem 3, with a face diagonal
irrational. Three are solutions to Problems 1 and 3, while the last is a
solution to Problems 1 and 2.




      Figure 12. Are there three Cycles of Solutions of (M) like this?
    Randall Rathbun has tirelessly pursued the grail of a perfect cuboid. He
has found 4394 cycles of the kind illustrated in Figure 11. He has searched
all integer cuboids with least edge between 44 and 23 2 - 1. He found no
perfect cuboids among the 17108 body cuboids, 10022 edge cuboids and
16465 face cuboids (total 43595).

DI9 Rational distances from the corners of a
square.
Is there a point all of whose distances from the corners of the unit square
are rational? It was earlier thought that there might not be any nontrivial
example (i.e., an example not on the edge of the square) of a point with
three such rational distances, but John Conway & Mike Guy found an
infinity of integer solutions of



where a, b, c are the distances of a point from three corners of a square of
edge s. There are relations between such solutions as shown in Figure 13.
    For the fourth distance d to be an integer we also need a2 + c2 = b2 + d2 .
In the three-distance problem, one of s, a, b, c is divisible by 3, one by 4,
and one by 5. In the four-distance problem, s is a multiple of 4 and a, b, c,
d are odd (assuming that there is no common factor). If s is not a multiple
of 3 (respectively 5) then two of a, b, c, d are divisible by 3 (resp. 5).

  Figure 13. A Solution of the Three-Distance Problem, and its Inverse.

    If the problem is generalized to a rational rectangle, then a 2 + c2 =
b2 +d2 is still required.This is the basis of a Martin Gardner puzzle [Math-
ematical Games, Sci. Amer. 210 #6 (June 1964), Problem 2, p.116]; see
also the Dodge reference below. A similar problem with a square with
an irrational edge and one irrational distance occurs in Dudeney, Canter-
bury Puzzles, No. 66, pp. 107-109, 212-213. Gardner sends a copy of
correspondence between Leslie J. Upton and J. A. H. Hunter. Hunter's
67-03-21 letter gives an infinity of solutions with the three distances in
A.P.: a = m 2 - 2mn + 2n2, b = m 2 + 2n2, c = m 2 + 2mn + 2n 2 and
8 2 = 2m 2(m 2 + 4n 2) where 8 is an integer if m = 2(u 2 + 2uv - v 2),
n = u 2 - 2uv - v 2. For example, there is a point at distances 85, 99
and 113 from three consecutive corners of a square of edge 140. It can be
shown that the fourth distance is never rational in such solutions.
    John Leech found points solving the three-distance problem which are
dense in the plane. These include the Conway-Guy solutions, and the 'in-
verses' (in the sense of Fig. 13) of the Hunter solutions. But there are
other solutions, and in some sense we now know "all" of them. Consider
the more general problem of dissecting a rational square into rational tri-
angles. It is known that at least four triangles are needed and there are
just four candidate arrangements, the 6-configuration, the II':-configuration,
the v-configuration and the x-configuration. The first two turn out to be
"duals" and solutions are given by the rational points on an infinite family
of elliptic curves. The first few hundred have been investigated by Brem-
ner and Guy, who have also dealt similarly with the v-configurations. The
x-configuration, i.e., the "four distance" problem, remains as an astonish-
ingly hard nut to crack.
    There are infinitely many solutions of the corresponding problem of
D. Diophantine Equations                                                   285

integer distances a, b, c from the corners of an equilateral triangle of edge
t. In each of these one of a, b, c, t is divisible by 3, one by 5, one by 7 and
one by 8. John Leech has sent us a neat and elementary proof of the fact
that the points at rational distances from the vertices of any triangle with
rational edges are dense in the plane of the triangle. This result was proved
earlier by Almering; see reference at D21. Arnfried Kemnitz notes that
a = m 2 +n2; b,c = m 2 ±mn+n2 with m = 2(u2 _v 2), n = u 2 +4uv+v 2
gives t = 8(u2 - v 2)(u2 + uv + v 2) and an infinity of solutions in which
the points are neither on the edges nor the circumcircle of the triangle. A
computer search showed that (57,65,73,112) was the smallest such.
    Kevin Buzzard found some parametric solutions to the problem of find-
ing integer-edged triangles whose Fermat-Torricelli point is at an integer
distance from each vertex - it should be possible to find "all" such solu-
tions, in the sense of Bremner's approach to equal sums of sixth powers
(reference at Dl). But it is probably a harder question to ask that the
triangles also be Heron. Berry writes the earlier displayed equation as

                 2(8 4 + b4 ) + a4 + c4 = 2(8 2 + b2)(a2 + c2)

and notes that this, and the corresponding equation

        ~+~+~+~=f~+f~+f2+~2+2~+~~

for the equilateral triangle, both represent Kummer surfaces, i.e., quartic
surfaces with just 16 singular points. They are not isomorphic, but are of
the same special type, known as tetrahedroids.
    There are the following consequences:
   • A Kummer surface is not rational: there is no general parametric
     solution of either problem, in the sense that there are no polynomials
     (resp. rational functions) giving all integer (resp. rational) solutions.
   • One-parameter families of solutions correspond to parametrizable
     curves on the surface. For example, the 16 conics (which always
     exist on a Kummer surface) give, in the equilateral triangle problem,
     points on the edges and circumcircle. The solution given by Arnfried
     Kemnitz corresponds to the plane section b + c = 2a.
   • The elliptic curves used by Bremner & Guy to find the delta-lambda
     configurations form a pencil on the former surface, and since the
     surfaces are both tetrahedroids, there may be an elliptic pencil on
     the "equilateral triangle" surface, which allows an analogous attack.
   Berry generalizes Almering's result by showing that if the squares on
the edges of a triangle are rational and at least one edge is rational, then
the set of points at rational distances from all three vertices is dense in the
plane of the triangle.
286                                     Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

    Jerry Bergum asks for what integers n do there exist positive integers
x, y with x 1.. y, x even, and x 2 + y2 = b2 & x 2 + (y - nx)2 = c2 both
perfect squares. If n = 2m (2m2 + 1), then x = 4m(4m 2 + 1), y = mx + 1
is a solution. There are no solutions if n = ±1, ±2, ±4, ±11 or ±p where
p == 3 mod 4 and p2 + 4 is prime, e.g., ±3, ±7. Bergum has several infinite
families of values of n for which there are solutions, e.g., n = 8t 2 ± 4t + 2
with t > O. There are solutions with n = ±5, ±6, ±8, ±9, ±14, ±19. If
n = 8, the least x for which there is a y is x = 2996760 = 23 ·3·5·13·17·113
and if n = 19 the least x is 2410442371920. One solution is n = 5, x = 120,
y = 391 as may be seen from Fig. 15(b)! The connexion between this
problem and the original one is that (x, y) are the coordinates of P at
distances band c from the origin 0 and an adjacent corner of the square
of edge s = nx where n is an integer.
    Ron Evans notes that the problem may be stated: which integers n
occur as the ratios base/height in integer-edged triangles? The sign of n
is ± according as the triangle is acute or obtuse (e.g., n = -29, x = 120,
y = 119 is a solution). He also asks the dual problem: find every integer-
edged triangle whose base divides its height. Here the height/base ratios
1 and 2 can't occur, but 3 can (e.g., base 4; edges 13, 15; height 12). If
a ratio can occur, are there infinitely many primitive triangles for which
it occurs? K. R. S. Sastry gives the triangles (3389, 21029, 24360) and
(26921, 42041, 68880) in each of which the ratio base/height is 42, and
(25,26,3) and (17,113,120) with ratios 1/8 and 8 (the third member of the
triple is the base in each case).

D20 Six general points at rational distances.
The first edition of this book asked "are there six points in the plane,
no three on a line, no four on a circle, all of whose mutual distances are
rational?" Leech pointed out that one such configuration is obtained by
fitting six copies of a triangle whose edges and medians are all rational.
Such triangles were studied by Euler (see D21): the simplest has edges
68, 85, 87 and medians the halves of 158, 131, 127 [Fig. 14(a)]. Harborth
& Kemnitz have shown that this triangle leads to the minimal configura-
tion of six points, no three collinear, no four concyclic, at integer mutual
distances. A related configuration is obtained by inversion in a concentric
circle; the six triangles are then similar but no longer congruent. Can any
such configuration be extended? Or are there any sets of more than six
such points? Kemnitz has exhibited an unsymmetrical set of six points at
integer distances, 13 of them distinct, the largest 319 [Fig. 14(b)].

    There are two opposite extreme conjectures: (a) that there is a fixed
number c such that any n points in a plane whose mutual distances are
rational include at least n - c which are collinear or concyclic, and (b)

(ascribed to Besicovitch, but in 1959 he expressed the contrary opinion)
that any polygon can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a polygon with
all its edges and diagonals rational. If (a) is valid, what is the maximum
value of c?
    If we have an infinite sequence of points {Xi} with all distances rational,
can we characterize the set of limit points? It was already known to Euler
that they could be dense on a circle. If the sequence is dense in the plane,
Ulam conjectured that not all distances could be rational. Does it contain
a dense subsequence with all distances irrational?
     We can choose a straight line and two points at unit distance from it
on a perpendicular line; then points on the first line at distances of the
form (u 2 - v 2 ) /2uv from the intersection form an infinite set of points with
rational mutual distances. By inversion in a circle centred at one of the
off-line points, we obtain a dense set of points on a circle, together with
its centre, with rational mutual distances. This proves Conjecture (b) for
cyclic polygons. Peeples (who quotes Huff) extended this to a straight line
with four points at distances ±p, ±q from it on a perpendicular line. If
q/p has a representation as the product of two distinct ratios of the form
(u 2 - v 2 )/2uv, then it has an infinity of them, and there will be an infinity
of points on the first line at rational distances from each other and from
the four off-line points. Thus c is at least 4 in Conjecture (a). By inversion
in a circle centred at one of the four off-line points, we obtain a dense set
of points on a circle, together with its centre and a pair of points inverse in
the circle, with rational mutual distances. Thus c is at least 3 for the circle
in Conjecture (a). Are these the maximum values of c for infinite sets?




                                                                             120

    What finite sets surpass these values of c? Leech gave an infinite family
of sets of nine points, with no more than four on any line or circle, so c = 5
for these sets. They are based on solutions of the simultaneous Diophantine
equations
D. Diophantine Equations                                                   289

most simply x = 120, Y = 209, z = 182 [Fig. 15(b)].
    Lagrange and Leech have given infinite families of pairs of triads of
integers al, a2, a3, and bl, b2, b3, such that the nine sums a~ + bJ are
all squares. These lead to sets of 13 points on two perpendicular lines,
comprising their intersection, points (±ai,O) on one line and points (O,±bj )
on the other, with integer mutual distances and no more then seven on
a line or four on a circle, so c = 6 for these sets. The simplest example
has ai = 952, 1800, 3536 and bj = 960, 1785, 6630. They also found an
example in which one triad is extended to a tetrad; it has

           ai   =   9282000,    26822600, 60386040,
           bj   =   7422030,    8947575, 22276800, 44142336,
but these still give only c = 6. Leech has since found three further examples.
Can a pair of tetrads be found with all 16 sums a~ + bJ square? If so we
would obtain a set of 17 points with integer mutual distances and c = 8.
    Noll and Bell search for configurations with no three points collinear
and no four concyclic, but using only lattice points. They call such config-
urations N-clusters. They, and independently William Kalsow & Bryan
Rosenburg, found the 6-cluster (0,0), (132,-720), (546,-272), (960,-720),
(1155,540), (546,1120). They define the extent of an N-cluster to be the
radius of the smallest circle, centred at one of the points, which contains
them all. They find 91 nonequivalent prime 6-clusters of extent less than
20937, but no 7-clusters.
    Harley Flanders sent all cyclic pentagons with integer edges and integer
circumradius R::; 51. The smallest and largest were

    Jordan & Peterson find pentagons with integer edges and diagonals, in

with edges 4,6,4,6,4 and opposite diagonals 8,8,7,8,8 and a pentagon with
edges 8,8,3,8,8 and diagonals 10,12,12,12,10.

D21 Triangles with integer edges, medians
and area.
Is there a triangle with integer edges, medians and area? There are, in
the literature, incorrect "proofs" of impossibility, but the problem remains
D. Diophantine Equations                                                   291


open. It may be instructive to would-be solvers to find the fallacies in the
arguments of Schubert and of Eggleston, referred to below. For some time
it had been suspected that not even two rational medians were possible in
a Heron triangle, but discoveries by Randall L. Rathbun, Arnfried Kemnitz
and R. H. Buchholz have shown that they can occur. Even more recently,
Rathbun has found infinitely many such, and it seems reasonable to con-
jecture that there are infinitely many infinite families, but this remains
undemonstrated, as does the existence or impossibility of three rational
medians. Buchholz & Rathbun show that any rational point on the curve
(xy + 2)(x - y + 1) = 3 with 0 < x,y < 1 and 2x + y > 1 corresponds to a
triangle with rational sides, rational area and two rational medians.
    If we don't require the area to be rational, there are many solutions.
Euler gave a parametric solution of degree five,

       a = 6>,4 + 20>,2 -18,   b, c = >,5 ± >,4 - 6>,3 ± 26>,2 + 9>, ± 9

with medians -2>,5 + 20>,3 + 54>., ±>,5 + 3>,4 ± 26>,3 - 18>,2 ± 9>, + 27.
Recently George Cole has shown that, up to symmetry, there are just two
parametric solutions of degree five, Euler's and a new one. These have not
so far yielded a non-degenerate triangle with rational area.
    A host of problems arise from Pythagorean triangles. Eckert asked if
there are two distinct Pythagorean triples whose products are equal, i.e.,
is there a solution of



in nonzero integers and Prothro asked if one product could be twice the
other. More generally Leech asks what small integers are the ratios of two
such products? Trivially xy(x 4 - y4) = 8zw(z4 - w 4 ) when x, y = z ± w.
Since every product is divisible by 3·4· 5, many integers are possible, from
13 = 5·12·13 upwards. More subtly 11 = 21·220·221 and imprimitively
       3·4·5                                13·84·85 '
                               63 . 24 . 143 . 145
                           6 = 135. 352 . 377

Are these the smallest?
   He also notes that one product is eight times the other on setting x, y =
z±w.
   How many primitive Pythagorean triangles can have the same area?
A triple of such, with generators (77,38), (78,55), (138,5) was found by
Charles L. Shedd in 1945. In 1986 Rathbun found three more:
(1610,869), (2002,1817), (2622,143);       (2035,266), (3306,61), (3422,55);
and      (2201,1166), (2438,2035), (3565,198).
   A fifth triple, (7238,2465), (9077,1122), (10434,731), was found inde-
pendently on consecutive days by Dan Hoey and Rathbun. Is there an
292                                  Unsolved Problems in Number Theory


infinity of triples? Are there quadruples? If they are not required to be
primitive, there can be arbitrarily many Pythagorean triangles with the
same area.
    Beiler gives four primitive Pythagorean triangles, each with perimeter
317460. Their generators are (286,269), (330,151), (370,59), (390,17). This
inspired Rathbun to find sets of 23 such primitive triangles. For example,
those with generators


 (254082,248563)     (254930,246043)     (255398,244657)     (257686,237929)
 (262922,222823)     (263670,220697)     (274010,192079)     (274170,191647)
 (277134,183701)     (283974,165761)     (288002,155443 )    (294690,138691)
 (295630,136373)     (297330,132203)     (310726,100289)     (311610, 98239)
 (323830, 70553)     (330410, 56119)     (332310, 52009)     (333370, 49727)
 (333982, 48413)     (348270, 18437)     (351390, 12061)

each have perimeter 255426093780. There are 11 other, imprimitive, trian-
gles with the same perimeter.
    Sastry asks for Pythagorean triangles with a triangular number and a
square for legs, and a pentagonal number, ~n(3n -1), for hypotenuse. Are
there any nontrivial examples besides (3,4,5) and (105,1O0,145)? Does it
help to allow pentagonal numbers of negative rank, ~n(3n + I)?
    Despairing of solving the problem of the rational box (DIB), some peo-
ple have investigated other polyhedra all of whose distances are integers.
There are seven topologically different convex hexahedra, for example, and
integer examples have been found by Harborth & Kemnitz (see D20) and
by Peterson & Jordan. Sastry asked for solutions to the rational box prob-
lem, but using triangular numbers instead of squares. Charles Ashbacher
gave the triangular numbers 66, 105, 105 whose sums of pairs and whose
total are all triangular. Alperin finds infinitely many hexahedra with four
congruent trapezoidal faces and two congruent rectangular faces, all edges,
face- and body-diagonals being integers.

D22 Simplexes with rational contents.
Are there simplexes in any number of dimensions, all of whose contents
(lengths, areas, volumes, hypervolumes) are rational? The answer is "yes"
in two dimensions; there are infinitely many Heron triangles with rational
edges and area. An example is a triangle of edges 13, 14, 15 which has area
84. The answer is also "yes" in three dimensions, but can all tetrahedra be
approximated arbitrarily closely by such rational ones?
    John Leech notes that four copies of an acute-angled Heron triangle
will fit together to form such a tetrahedron, provided that the volume is
294                                       Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

made rational, and this is not difficult. E.g., three pairs of opposite edges
of lengths 148, 195, 203. This is the smallest example: he finds the next
few triples to be
        (533,875,888),(1183,1479,1804),(2175,2296,2431),(1825,2748,2873),
  (2180,2639,3111),(1887,5215,5512),(6409,6625,8484),(8619,10136,11275).
He also suggests examining references on p. 224 of Vol II of Dickson's

    Dickson appealed for a copy of this last. Did he ever get one? Does
anyone know of a copy? Would they be willing to donate it, or offer it for
sale, to the Strens Collection?
   Leech also notes that this problem is answered positively in three di-
mensions by solutions to Problem 3 in, D18 (find a box which is rational
except for one face diagonal). This problem was published as Problem
930 in Crux Mathematicorum, 10(1984) #3, p. 89, and the solution by
the COPS (presumably an acronym for the Carleton (Ottawa) Problem
Solvers) is:
   Take a tetrahedron with a path of three mutually perpendicular edges,
a = p2q2 - r 2s2, b = 2pqrs, c = p2r2 - q2s2. Then a 2 + b2, b2 + c2 are
squares and a 2 + b2 + c2 = (P4 + S4) (q4 + r 4) is a square if
                                 p4 + s4 = q4 + r4.

       [John Leech notes "but not only if" and gives four casual examples,

           (14 + 24)(24 + 134) = 6972 ;    (14 + 24)(38 4 + 43 4) = 9673 2 ;

  (14 + 24)(3144 + 8634) = 12756432 ;         (14 + 34)(94 + 4374) = 17292982 ,
which imply further ones of type (24 + 134)(384 + 43 4).]
   This equation was solved by Euler. The solution mentioned in D9 is

    Dove & Sumner relax the condition that the faces of a tetrahedron have
rational area and find two tetrahedra with volume 3 and pairs of opposite
edges (32,76) (33,70) (35,44) and (21,58) (32,76) (47,56). They ask if there
are infinitely many tetrahedra with integer edges and the same integer
volume. Is there such a tetrahedron with volume any given multiple of 3?
They have examples from 3 to 99, except for 87.
    The tetrahedron with a pair of opposite edges 896 and 990 and the
other four edges each 1073, two face areas 436800 and 471240, and volume
62092800, is mentioned by Sierpinski and by Leitzmann.
    Mohammed Aassila shows the existence of infinitely many pairs of
Heron triangles with common area and perimeter. Ronald van Luijk has
outlined (02-10-21 email) a proof that there are arbitrarily large sets of
Heron triangles with common perimeter and area. Randall Rathbun has
given a set of eight with perimeter 128700 and area 594594000:
            {53262, 52338, 23100} {55440,48950,24310}

D23 Some quartic equations.
See also D3, D6, D9, DIO.
   Another of many unsolved diophantine equations is



though Schinzel & Sierpinski have found all solutions for which x - y = 2z.
Cao Zhen-Fu has shown that the only solutions satisfying x - y = lz for
other values of 1 :::; 30 are Ixl = Iyl or Izl = 1, and Wang Van Bin that
these are the only solutions with x - y = Z2 + 1. Szymiczek considered
the equation and excluded trivial solutions by assuming that x < z < y.
He noted the nontrivial solution (3,17,7) and Sierpinski's observation that
the problem of finding three triangular numbers in geometric progression
is equivalent to finding odd nontrivial solutions of the equation. But this
had been solved by Gerardin and was solved again by Szymiczek: if the
nth triangular number, tn, is a square, m 2, then so is t3n+4m+1 and tn,
t n+2m , t3n+4m+l form a G.P.
    Among sporadic solutions (not of the special kind considered by Schinzel
& Sierpinski) Szymiczek notes (4,11,31), (2,13,97), (155,2729,48049) of
which the third yields a triple of triangular numbers, t77, t 1364, t24024,
in G.P., but not of the above form. Szymiczek conjectures that the answer
to SierpiJiski's question: are there four triangular numbers in G.P.? is "no!"
    Ronald van Luijk observes that the equation represents a singular K3
surface with an elliptic fibration of positive rank, so that the rational points
are dense. [For experts, a correspondent writes that 'it can certainly be
approached with the relatively standard technique of computing the Neron-
Severi group, in order to find parametrizable curves of small degree.')
    Another K3 surface, enquired about by Henri Cohen, has equation
(x 2 - y2)(1 - x 2y2) = z2. Daniel Coray, in an 02-10-25 email message,
gives some of the infinitely many parametric solutions.
    Kashihara has shown that all solutions of

                           (x 2 - 1)(y2 - 1) = (z2 - 1)

can be derived from the trivial solutions (n, 1, 1) and (1, n, 1).
    For the equation x 2 - 1 = y2 (Z2 - 1), Mignotte has shown that if z is
large, then the greatest prime factor of y is at least cln In y.
    Ron Graham has observed that the diophantine equations
D. Diophantine Equations                                                    297

each have the solutions x = 0,1,2,3,6 and 91. Is this merely an example of
the Law of Small Numbers? Evidently so! Stroeker & de Weger find that
Graham's equation has one pair and five quadruples of solutions. They
note that it is unfair to count the solutions x = 0 and x = 1 of the
Ramanujan-Nagell equation as separate, while 'forgetting' the solutions
x = -1, -2, -5, -90.
   Ljunggren showed that X4 - Dy2 = 1 has at most two solutions; Le
Mao-Hua showed that it has at most one iflnD > 64, and Cipu that it has
at most one if D =I- 1785.
   Venkatesh showed that x4 + 5x 2y2 + y4 = z2 has no solutions with
xy=l-O.
   Baragar has shown that the equation

                        x(x + l)y(y + 1) = z(z + 1),

studied by Katayama, is equivalent to a Markoff type equation (see D12)
                           x 2 + y2 + z2 = 2xyz + 5

and has counted the number of solutions of size less than N.
    Not a quartic, but probably suggested by the opening equation in this
section: Michael Bennett (W. No. Theory Problem 97:08) asked if there
are any solutions of
                            x 2 - 1 = (z2 _ 1)2
                              y2 -1
with x,y, z > 1 other than (x,y, z) = (m(4m 2 -3),m, 2m) with m ~ 2 and
(8m4 + 16m3 + 8m 2 - 1, 2m2 + 2m, 2m + 1) with m ~ 1. He has shown
that there are at most three solutions of two simultaneous Pell equations
and conjectures that there are at most two.

D24 Sum equals product.
For the case k = 3 with sum and product 1 there is an extensive literature.
See MR 99a:11034 for a pocket survey.
   For k > 2 the equation al a2 ..• ak = al + a2 + ... + ak has the solution
al = 2, a2 = k, a3 = a4 = ... = ak = 1. Schinzel showed that there is
no other solution in positive integers for k = 6 or k = 24. Misiurewicz has
shown that k = 2, 3, 4, 6, 24, 114 (misprinted as 144 in Elem. Math. and in
300                                    Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

the first edition of this book), 174 and 444 are the only k < 1000 for which
there is exactly one solution. The search has been extended by Singmaster,
Bennett & Dunn to k :::; 1440000. They let N(k) be the number of different
'sum = product' sequences of size k, and conjecture that N(k) > 1 for all
k > 444. They find that N(k) = 2 for 49 values of k up to 120000, the
largest being 6174 and 6324, and conjecture that N(k) > 2 for k > 6324.
They also find that N(k) = 3 for 78 values of k in the same range, the
largest being 7220 and 11874, and conjecture that N(k) > 3 for k > 11874;
also that N(k) -+ 00.
    This problem seems first to have been asked by Trost, arising from the
solution of al a2 ... ak = al + a2 + ... + ak = 1 in rationals. For k = 3 this
is due to Sierpinski; for k > 3 to Schinzel.

D25 Equations involving factorial n.
Are the only solutions of n! + 1 = x 2 given by n = 4, 5 and 7? Overholt
has related this problem to a conjecture of Szpiro. Erdos & Obhith dealt
with the equation n! = x P ± yP with x 1- y and p > 2. For the case p = 2
with the plus sign, see Leech's remark at D2j and for the minus sign, split
n! into two even factors: 4! = 52 _12 = 72 - 52; 5! = 112 _12 = 132 -72 =
172 - 132 = 31 2 - 292. The number of solutions is ~d(n!/4).
    Simmons notes that n! = (m - l)m(m + 1) for (m, n) = (2,3), (3,4),
(5,5) and (9,6) and asks if there are other solutions. More generally he asks
if there are any other solutions of n! + x = xk. This is a variation on the
question of asking for n! to be the product of k consecutive integers in a
nontrivial way (k =f. n + 1 - j!). Compare B23.
    Berend & Osgood have shown that the set of n for which the equation
P(x) = n! has an integer solution x has density zero if P(x) is a polynomial
of degree 2 2 with integer coefficients.
    Yu & Liu show that the only solutions of (p - I)! + a P- 1 = pk are
(p, a, k) = (3,1,1), (5,1,2), (3,5,3).
     Zoltan Sasvari mentions the equation

                       (n + 1)(n + 2),,· (n + k)
                       7---~~--7-~----~=m
                       (n -1)(n - 2)··· (n - k)

When m = 2 the only solution is (n, k) = (3,1) and for m = 3, (n, k) =
(2,1). Solutions always occur for k = n - 1 and k = n - 2, namely m =
the binomial coefficient (2nn-l) and the Catalan number ~ e:-=-12). Selfridge
notes that whenever k = n - 3 gives a solution, then so does k = n - 4 (e.g.,
n = 7, 16,21,29,43,46,67,78,89,92, 105, 111, 127, 141, 154, 157, 171,
188, 191, ... ), but not necessarily vice versa (e.g., n = (4), 13, 19,85, 100,
121, 199, ... ). Sasvari found the sporadic solution n = 101, k = 95, and
Marc Paulhus found several others. Here are some other examples where
the entries, 8, 7, ... are values of i where k = n - i.

D26 Fibonacci numbers of various shapes.
Stark asks which Fibonacci numbers (see A3) are half the difference or
sum of two cubes. This is related to the problem of finding all complex
quadratic fields of class number 2. Examples: 1 = ~(13+ 13),8 = ~(23+23),
D. Diophantine Equations                                                     303


13 = ~(33_13). Antoniadis has related all such fields to solutions of certain
diophantine equations, and solved them all but two, which were later settled
by de Weger.
    Cohn showed that the only square Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1 and 144,
and Luo Ming confirmed Vern Hoggatt's conjecture that the only triangular
ones, i.e. of the form ~m(m + 1) are 0, 1, 3, 21 and 55, and later that the
only such Lucas numbers are 1, 3 and 5778. He also shows that the only
pentagonal numbers in the two sequences are respectively 1, 5 and 2, 1, 7.
    Grossman & Luca show that the largest Fibonacci and Lucas numbers
which can be expressed as the sum or difference of two factorials are 144 =
5! + 4! and 18 = 4! - 3! hGidxfactorial
    B. M. M. de Weger has proved that the largest Fibonacci number which
is of the form y2 - Y - 1 is U11 = 55 = 82 - 8 - 1. His proof is more than 10
pages long and uses the Thue equations. Elementary proof wanted. This
reported by Flammenkamp who asks if the only members of the Lucas
sequence Vo = 2, VI = 1 and V n +2 = Vn+I + Vn which are differences of two
consecutive cubes are VI = 13 - 03, V4 = 23 - 13 and VI7 = 353 - 343.
    On 2003-11-25, Yann Bugeaud emailed that he, M. Mignotte & S. Siksek
have shown that 0, 1, 8, 144 are the only perfact powers in the Fibonacci
sequence. One might also allow -1 and -8.

D27 Congruent numbers.
Congruent numbers are perhaps confusingly named; they are related
to Pythagorean triangles and have an ancient history. Several examples
(5, 6, 14, the seventeen entries CA in Table 7, and ten more greater than
1000) are in an Arab manuscript more than a thousand years ago. But it
is only for the last twenty years, since the work of Thnnell, that we have a
reasonably complete understanding of them. They are those integers a for
which
                     x 2 + ay2 = z2 and x 2 - ay2 = t 2
have simultaneous integer solutions. Part of the fascination is the often in-
ordinate size of the smallest solutions. For example, a = 101 is a congruent
number and Bastien gave the smallest solution:

      x = 2015242462949760001961         y = 118171431852779451900

      z = 2339148435306225006961         t = 1628124370727269996961

and it spite of improved computing techniques and machines, it may still be
some time before some other of the more recalcitrant examples are discov-
ered. Some other large specimens, found by J. A. H. Hunter, M. R. Buckley
and K. Gallyas, are given in the first edition of this book.
    Congruent numbers are equivalently defined as those a for which there
are solutions of the diophantine equation



    Dickson's History gives many early references, including Leonardo of
Pisa (Fibonacci); Genocchi; and Gerardin, who gave 7, 22, 41, 69, 77, the
twenty Arabic examples and the forty-three entries CG in Table 7. We
need consider only squarefree values of a; of the 608 such that are less
than 1000, 361 are congruent and 247 are noncongruent. It has long been
conjectured that squarefree numbers are congruent if they are      =5, 6 or
7 mod 8. Since the work of Thnnell, this is now known to be true. He
has also shown that if n is odd and congruent, then the number of triples
satisfying 2x 2+y2+8z 2 = n is twice the number satisfying 2x 2+y2+32z2 =
n. Is the converse true?
    The entries C5 or C7, and C6 in Table 7 are for primes = 5 or 7 mod 8,
and the doubles of primes   =  3 mod 8. Bastien observed that the follow-
ing are noncongruent: primes = 3 mod 8; products of two such primes;
the doubles of primes = 5 mod 8; the doubles of the products of two such

primes; and the doubles of primes == 9 mod 16; these are the respective en-
tries N3, N9, NX, NL and N2 in Table 7. He gave some other noncongruent
numbers (entries NB, though a = 1 is due to Fermat, and many others were
known earlier, e.g. to Genocchi) and stated that a was noncongruent if it
was a prime == 1 mod 8 with a = b2 + c2 and b + c a nonresidue (see F5) of
a. This accounts for several of the entries Nl.
    Note that the entries 1, 3, 5 and 7 serve as a table of primes in these
residue classes mod 8.
    Entries C& and N& are from Alter, Curtz & Kubota, and CJ and NJ
from Jean Lagrange's thesis.

                         -w + -x + -y + -z + - - = o.
                                             wxyz
Several papers have appeared, giving parametric families of solutions. For
example, Takahiro Nagashima sends solutions to Mordell's equation:
(w,x,y,z)              (5,3,2,-1),       (-7,-3,-2,1),      (31,-5,-3,2),
(1366, -15, 7, -13), (n+ 1, -n, -1, 1) and more generally w = xyz+ 1 with

              x = -2Eh3 - &h2 (n - 3) + Eh(n - 1 - 2&) + 1,

                   Y = 2&h 2 + Eh(n - 3) - E8(n -1) + 1,
                         z = -2&h 2 - Eh(n - 1) - 1,
where E, 8 = ±1 independently, but there seems to be no guarantee that
these four two-parameter families give all solutions.
    Zhang has shown how to obtain all solutions below a given bound, while
Clellie Oursler and Judith Longyear have sent extensive analyses which
each give a procedure for finding all solutions. That of Longyear extends
to the equation E(1/Xi) + I1(I/Xi) = 0 with n(~ 3) variables Xi in place
of Mordell's n = 4.

D29 Diophantine m-tuples.
A set of positive integers {al, ... ,am } is called a Diophantine m-tuple
with property D(n) if aiaj + n is a perfect square for all 1 ::; i < j ::; m.
Fermat found the property D(I) Diophantine 4-tuple {I, 3, 8, I20}. Baker
& Davenport proved that the Diophantine triple {I, 3, 8} can be extended
in only one way to a Diophantine 4-tuple, so that it can't be extended to a
Diophantine 5-tuple. Dujella & Peth6 generalize this by showing that the
pair {I,3} can be extended to infinitely many Diophantine 4-tuples, but
not to a Diophantine 5-tuple. In fact a Diophantine 5-tuple with property
D(I) is not known. Dujella has shown that there cannot exist a 9-tuple
with property D(I)). A Diophantine 5-tuple with property D(256) and a 6-
tuple with property D(2985984) are known, namely {I, 33,105,320, I8240}
(Dujella) and {99, 315, 9920, 32768, 44460, I9534284} (Gibbs).
    Dujella, Fuchs & Clemens extend the problem from integers to polyno-
mials. The set {al' ... , am} forms a polynomial D (n )-m- tuple if, for all 1 ::;
i < j ::; m, aiaj + n is the square of a polynomial with integer coefficients.
They show that if n is a linear polynomial, then a polynomial D(n)-m-tuple
has at most 26 elements. The example {x, I6x + 8, 25x + 14, 36x + 20} with
n = I6x + 9 has 4 elements.
    Bugeaud & Dujella have extended the problem to higher powers.

    Paul Thran (editor), Number Theory and Analysis; a collection of papers in
honor of Edmund Landau (1877-1938), Plenum Press, New York, 1969, contains
several papers, by Erdos and others, on sequences of integers.
    We will denote by A = {ai}, i = 1, 2, ... a possibly infinite strictly increasing
sequence of nonnegative integers. The number of ai which do not exceed x is
denoted by A(x). By the density of a sequence we will mean limA(x)/x, if it
exists.


El A thin sequence with all numbers equal to
a member plus a prime.
Erdos offers $50.00 for a solution of the problem: does there exist a sequence thin
enough that A(x) < cln x, but with every sufficiently large integer expressible in

                                                                                 311
312                                      Unsolved Problems in Number Theory


the form p + ai where p is a prime?
    For the analogous problem with squares in place of primes, Leo Moser showed
that A(x) > (1 + c)y'x for some c > 0, while Erdos showed that there was a
sequence with A(x) < cy'x. Moser's best value for c was 0.06, but this has been
improved to 0.147 by Abbott, to 0.245 by Balasubramanian & Soundarajan, and
to 0.273 by Cilleruelo. For the rth powers, Cilleruelo obtains
                                                1-.!

                            A(x) > r(2 _ ~)r(1 +~)

     For the problem with powers of two in place of primes, Ruzsa obtained the
analog of Erdos's result, but it is not known if there is a constant c > 0 such that
every sequence A for which every positive integer is representable in the form
a + 2k has A(x) > (1 + c) log2 x.

                        (9xj8)1/2 ~ maxA(x) ~ (4X)1/2.

    The lower bound is obtained by taking all the numbers from 1 up to       ..JX72
and then the even numbers up to v'2x.
    And how many numbers less than x can we find with the greatest common
divisor of any pair < t for a given t? If t < n!+<, the number", 7r(n), while if
t = n!+c, it is '" (1 + c')7r(n).
    Erdos also asks for bounds on B(x), the smallest number so that any subset
of [1, xl of cardinality B(x) always contains three members which have pairwise
the same least common multiple. Perhaps B(x) = o(x). Again, let G(x) be the
corresponding smallest cardinality, so that there are always three numbers with
pairwise the same greatest common divisor. No doubt

                         e C1 (lnx)l/2 < G(x) < e C2 (lnx)l/2   ?

but the best that Erdos has proved is C(x) < x 3 / 4 .
    Given a sequence A, al < a2 < ... , Erdos & Szemeredi denote by F(A,x,k)
the number of i for which the I.c.m. [aHl, aH2, ... , aHk] < x, and ask if it
is true that for every € > 0 there is a k for which F(A, x, k) < x<? They
proved that F(A, x, 3) < Clx 1 / 3 ln x for every A, and that there is an A for which
F(A, x, 3) > C2x 1 / 3 ln x for infinitely many x, but they don't know ifthere is an
A for which this is true for all x.
    Graham, Spencer & Witsenhausen ask how dense can a sequence of integers
be so that {n, 2n, 3n} never occur?

E3 Density of integers with two comparable
divisors.
Is it true that the density of those integers
      6, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 28, 30, 35, 36, 40, 42, 45, 48, 54, 56, 60, 63, 66,
70,72, ...
which have two divisors d 1 , d2 such that d 1 < d2 < 2d1 , is one? Erdos
has shown that the density exists. There is a connexion with covering
congruences (F13). Since the first edition this has been solved affirmatively
by Maier & Tenenbaum.
    Let A be a strictly increasing sequence of integers exceeding 1 and let
M(A) := {rna: a E A, rn 2: I} denote its set of multiples. Call A a
Behrend sequence if M(A) has asymptotic density 1. Erdos notes that
a central problem is to find general criteria to decide if a given sequence A
is Behrend.

E4 Sequence with no member dividing the
product of r others.
If no member of the sequence {ai} divides the product of r ;::: 2 other terms,
Erdos shows that



where 7r(x) is the number of primes::; x If, however, we suppose that the
products of any number, not greater than r, of the ai are distinct, what is
maxA(x)? For r ;::: 3, Erdos shows

                       maxA(x) < 7r(x) + O(x 2 / 3+f ).

   If r = 1, so that no term divides any other, the sequence is called
primitive. Zhang has shown that for a primitive sequence whose members
each contain at most four prime factors,




(and hence less than 1.64) for n > 1, the sums being taken over all members
of the sequence up to n and all primes up to n.
    A month before Erdos died he emailed:

      Let al < a2 < ... < ak ::; x be a sequence of integers ::; x no
      one of which divides any other. max k = [(x + 1) /2] is of course
      well known. Let A = {al < a2 < ... < ak ::; x}, denote by
      f(A; n) the number of ai ::; n. How large can L~=l f(A; n) be?
      Is it true that the maximum is (x 2 )/6 + O(x)? The maximum
      is given perhaps by the integers x/3 ::; ai < 2x/3.

E7 A series and a sequence involving primes.
If Pn is the nth prime, Erdos asks if 2:( -1)nn/Pn converges. He notes that
the series 2:( -1)n(n In n)/Pn diverges.
    He also asks if, given three distinct primes and al < a2 < a3 < ...
are all the products of their powers arranged in increasing order, it is true
infinitely often that ai and ai+1 are both prime powers. And what if we
use k primes or even infinitely many in place of three? Meyer & Tijdeman
have asked a similar question for two finite sets 8 and T of primes with
al < a2 < a3 < ... formed from S U T. Are there infinitely many i for
which ai is a product of powers of primes from 8, while ai+1 is a product
of powers of primes from T?


E8 Sequence with no sum of a pair a square.
Paul Erdos & David Silverman consider k integers 1 ~ al < a2 < ... <
ak ~ n such that no sum ai + aj is a square. Is it true that k < n(1 + £)/3,
or even that k < n/3 + 0(1) ? The integers == 1 mod 3 show that if this is
true, then it is best possible. They suggest that the same question could
be asked for other sequences instead of the squares.
    Erdos & Graham added to their book at the proof stage that J. P. Mas-
sias has discovered that the sum of any two integers
                 == 1,5,9,13,14,17,21,25,26,29,30 mod 32
is never a square mod 32, so k can be chosen to be at least lln/32. This
is best possible for the modular version of the problem since Lagarias,
Odlyzko & Shearer have shown that if 8 ~ !In and 8 + 8 contains no
square of !In, then 181 ~ lln/32.

E9 Partitioning the integers into classes with

The conjecture of K. F. Roth, that there exists an absolute constant c
so that for every k there is an no = no(k) with the following property:
For n > no, partition the integers not exceeding n into k classes {a~j)},
(1 ~ j ~ k)j then the number of distinct integers not exceeding n which
can be written in the form a~~) + aW for some j is greater than en, has
been confirmed by Erdos, Sark6zy & S6s.

EIO Theorem of van der Waerden.
Szemeredi's theorem. Partitioning the
integers into classes; at least one contains an
A.P.
The well-known theorem of van der Waerden states that for every l there is a
number n(h, l) such that if the integers not exceeding n(h, l) are partitioned
into h classes, then at least one class contains an arithmetic progression
(A.P.) containing l + 1 terms. More generally, given lo, h, ... , lh-l, there
is always a class ~ (0 ::; i ::; h - 1) containing an A.P. of li + 1 terms.
Denote by W(h, l), or more generally W(h; lo, it, ... , lh-l), the least such
n(h, l).
    Chvatal computed W(2; 2, 2) = 9, W(2; 2, 3) = 18, W(2; 2,4) = 22,
W(2; 2, 5) = 32 and W(2; 2, 6) = 46 and Beeler & O'Neil give W(2; 2, 7) =
58, W(2; 2,8) = 77 and W(2; 2, 9) = 97. The values W(2; 3, 3) = 35 and
W(2; 3, 4) = 55 were found by Chvatal and W(2; 3, 5) = 73 by Beeler
& O'Neil. Stevens & Shantaram found W(2; 4, 4) = 178; Chvatal found
W(3; 2, 2, 2) = 27 and Brown W(3; 2, 2, 3) = 51. Beeler & O'Neil also
found W(4; 2, 2, 2, 2) = 76.
   Most proofs of van der Waerden's theorem give poor estimates for
W(h, l). Erdos & Rado showed that W(h, l) > (2lhl)! and Moser, Schmidt,
318                                   Unsolved Problems in Number Theory


and Berlekamp successively improved this to

          W(h, l) > lhclnh    and     W(h, l) > hl+ 1- cV(l+1) In(I+1)

Moser's bound has been improved for l ~ 5 by Abbott & Liu to
                             W(h, l) > hc .(lnh)8
    where s is defined by 28 ::; l < 28 +1 , and Everts has shown that
W(h, l) > lhl /4(l+1)2, a result which is sometimes better than Berlekamp's.
For h = 2 SzabO has recently shown that W(2, l) > 21 /le. All upper bounds
were 'ackermanic' in size, until Shelah's proof reduced them to 'wowser' -
for an explanation of these terms see the book by Graham, Rothschild &
Spencer.
    A closely related function, with l + 1 = k, is the now famous rk(n),
introduced long years ago by Erdos & Thnin: the least r such that the
sequence 1 ::; a1 < a2 < ... < a r ::; n of r numbers not exceeding n must
contain a k-term A.P. The best bounds when k = 3 are due to Behrend,
Roth, and Moser:
                   nexp( -Cl vln n) < r3(n) < C2n/ lnln n
    and for larger k Rankin showed that
                                    1-c /(lnn)8/(S+1)
                          rk n > n
                            ()          S


   where s, much as before, is defined by 28 < k ::; 28+1.
   A big breakthrough was Szemeredi's proof that rk(n) = o(n) for all
k, but neither his proof, nor those of Furstenberg and of Katznelson &
Ornstein (see Thouvenot) give estimates for rk(n). Erdos conjectures that

                      rk(n) = o(n(1n n)-t) for every t         ?

This would imply that for every k there are k primes in A.P. See A5 for a
potentially remunerative conjecture of Erdos, which, if true, would imply
Szemeredi's theorem.
    Gowers and others have shown that r3(n) < cn/(lnlnn)2/3 and that
rk(n) < n/(lnlnlnn)Ck.
    Another closely related problem was considered by Leo Moser, who
wrote the integers in base three, n = L: ai3i (ai = 0, lor 2) and examined
the mapping of n into lattice points (at, a2, a3, ... ) of infinite-dimensional
Euclidean space. He called integers collinear if their images are collinear;
e.g., 35 - (2,2,0,1,0, ... ), 41 - (2,1,1,1,0, ... ) and 47 - (2,0,2,1,0, ... )
are collinear. He conjectured that every sequence of integers with no three
collinear has density zero. If integers are collinear, they are in A.P., but not
necessarily conversely (e.g., 16 - (1,2,1,0,0, ... ), 24 - (0,2,2,0,0, ... )
and 32 - (2,1,0,1,0, ... ) are not collinear) so truth of the conjecture
would imply Roth's theorem that r3(n) = o(n).
    If h (n) is the largest number of lattice points with no three in line in
the n-dimensional cube with three points in each edge, then Moser showed
that h(n) > c3 n /..;n. It is easy to see that h(n)/3n tends to a limit; is it
E. Sequences of Integers                                                   319


zero? Chvatal improved the constant in Moser's result to 3/ Vii and found
the values !J(1) = 2, !J(2) = 6, !J(3) = 16. It is known that !J(4) ~ 43.
    More generally, if the n-dimensional cube has k points in each edge,
Moser asked for an estimate of !k (n), the maximum number of lattice
points with no k collinear. It is a theorem of Hales & Jewett, with appli-
cations to n-dimensional k-in-a-row (tic-tac-toe), that for sufficiently large
n, any partition of the k n lattice points into h classes has a class with k
points in line. This implies van der Waerden's theorem on letting the point
(ao, al, ... , an-I), (0 S ai S k - 1) correspond to the base k expansion of
the integer E aiki. It is not known whether, for every c and sufficiently
large n, it is possible to choose ck n / Vn points without including k in line.
It is known for some c. Inequality (4) in Riddell's second paper quoted
below implies that
                         fk(n) > kn + l /(27re 3 (k - l)n)~
    so that one can choose a "line-free" set of ck n / Vn points for some c.
In the other direction he obtains !J(n) S 16· 3n - 3 . He acknowledges Leo
Moser's inspiration in obtaining these results.
    If you use the greedy algorithm to construct sequences not containing
an A.P. you don't get a very dense sequence, but you do get some interesting
ones. Odlyzko & Stanley construct the sequence 8(m) of positive integers
with ao = 0, al = m and each subsequent an+l is the least number greater
than an so that ao, aI, ... , an+l does not contain a three-term A.P. For
example
    8(1): 0,1,3,4,9, 10, 12, 13, 27, 28, 30, 31, 36, 37, 39, 40, 81, 82, 84,
85, 90, 91, 93, 94, 108, 109, 111, 112, 117, 118, 120, ...
    8(4): 0, 4, 5, 7, 11, 12, 16, 23, 26, 31, 33, 37, 38, 44, 49, 56, 73, 78,
80,85,95,99,106,124,128,131,136,143, ...
If m is a power of three, or twice a power of three, then the members of the
sequence are fairly easy to describe (write 8(1) in base 3), but for other
values the sequences behave quite erratically. Their rates of growth seem
to be similar, but this has yet to be proved.
    The "simplest" such sequence containing no four-term A.P. is
        0, 1, 2, 4, 5, ~ 8, ~ 14, 15, 16, 18, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 33, 36,
                      48, 49, 50, 52, 53, 55, 56, 57, 62, ...
Is there a simple description of this? How fast does it grow?
    If we define the span of a set 8 to be max 8 - min 8, what is the smallest
span sp(k, n) of a set of n integers containing no k-term A.P.? The following
values have been corrected and extended by Rainer Rosenthal:

                 n = 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 .. .
          sp(3, n) = 348 10 12 13 192325 29 31 35 39 40 50 .. .
          sp(4, n) = 45 7 8 9 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 27 .. .

   Abbott notes that it follows from Szemenldi's theorem that for each
320                                    Unsolved Problems in Number Theory


k ~ 3, the sequence {sp(k, n + 1)- sp(k, n)} is unbounded, and asks if it
contains a bounded subsequence.

Ell Schur's problem. Partitioning integers
into sum-free classes.
Schur proved that if the integers less than n!e are partitioned into n classes
in any way, then x + y = z can be solved in integers within one class.
Let s(n) be the largest integer such that there exists a partition of the
integers [1, s(n)] into n classes with no solutions in any class. Abbott
& Moser obtained the lower bound s(n) > (89)n/4-clnn for some c and
all sufficiently large n and Abbott & Hanson obtained s(n) > c(89)n/4,
improving Schur's own estimate of s(n) ~ (3 n + 1)/2. This last result is
in fact sharp for n = 1, 2 and 3, but it is too low for larger values of n.
The value s(4) = 44 was computed by Baumert: for example, the first 44
numbers may be split into four sum-free classes

    {1,3,5,15,17,19,26,28,40,42,44},       {2, 7,8,18,21,24,27,33,37,38,43},
  {4,6,13,20,22,23,25,30,32,39,41} ,       {9,10,11,12,14,16,29,31,34,35,36}.

    Later Fredricksen showed that 8(5) ;::: 157 (see E12 for his example) and
this improves the lower bound for all subsequent Schur numbers: 8(n) ;:::
c(315)n/5 (n> 5).
    Robert Irving has slightly improved Schur's upper bound from Ln!eJ to
Ln!(e- 214)J. This result also appears in O'Sullivan's Ph.D. thesis (see E28).
Eugene Levine says that this seems to be the best that can be deduced
from Jon Folkman's result that the Ramsey number R(3, 3, 3, 3) ::; 65.
Also, Schinzel notes that the result ascribed to Irving was attributed by
the latter to Earl Glen Whitehead.
    If 8 and y are required to be distinct, then Irving showed that the
corresponding bound is L~(2n + l)e . n!J + 2, which Bornsztein slightly
improves to LnIneJ + 1.
    Denote by v = a( m, n) the least integer v such that any partition of
{I, 2, ... ,v} into n subsets has a part containing al, ... , am (not neces-
sarily distinct) which satisfy al + ... + am-l = am, i.e., 8(n) = a(3, n).
Beutelspacher & Brestovansky note that a(m, 1) = m - 1 and a(2, n) = 1
and prove that a(m, 2) = m 2 - m - 1. They exhibit 3-sumfree 6- and 7-
partitions that show that a(3, 6) ;::: 476 & a(3, 7) ;::: 1430. Hence a(3, n) ;:::
~(2859·3n-7 +1) for n ;::: 7. They also define and investigate Schur numbers
of arithmetic progressions.
    E. & G. Szekeres and SchOnheim have considered what Bill Sands calls
an un-Schur problem. Call a partition ofthe integers [1, n] into three classes
admissible if there is no solution to x+y = z with x, y, z in distinct classes.
There is no admissible partition with the size of each class > ~n.

                                                           t
    Is it true that if the integers are split into r classes, then some class
contains three distinct integers x, y, z satisfying ~ + = ~? T. C. Brown
has verified this for r = 2.

E12 The modular version of Schur's problem.
A similar problem to Schur's was considered by Abbott & Wang. Let t(n)
be the largest integer m so that there is a partition of the integers from 1
to minto n classes, with no solution to the congruence
                           x + y == z mod (m + 1)
    in any class. Clearly t(n) ::; 8(n), where 8(n) is as in Schur's problem
(Ell), but for n = 1, 2 or 3, we have equality, t(l) = 8(1) = 1, t(2) =
8(2) = 4, t(3) = 8(3) = 13. Indeed, the only three partitions of [1,13] into
three sets satisfying the sum-free condition,
                   {1,4,10,13} {2,3,11,12} {5,6,8,9}
    (with 7 in any of the three sets) all satisfy the seemingly more re-
strictive congruence-free condition, modulo 14, while Baumert's example
(Ell) shows only one failure: 33 + 33 == 21 mod 45 in the second set. In
fact Baumert found 112 ways of partitioning [1,44] into four sum-free sets,
and some of these are sum-free mod 45, so t( 4) = 44. An example is
           {±1, ±3, ±5, 15, ±17, ±19}, {±2, ±7, ±8, ±18, ±21}
       {±4, ±6, ±13, ±20, ±22, 30}, {±9, ±1O, ±11, ±12, ±14, ±16}.

      Abbott & Wang obtained the inequality
                          f(nl + n2) 2: 2f(ndf(n2)
which holds for f(n) = s(n) - ~ and leads to the same lower bound that
Schur obtained for his problem, t(n) 2: (3 n + 1)/2. Indeed, they obtain
evidence that t(n) = s(n). Moreover, the example of Fredricksen
                ±{1,4, 10, 16, 21, 23, 28, 34,40, 43,45,48, 54, 60},
          ±{2,3,8,9,14,19,20,24,25,30,31,37,42,47,52,65,70},
       ±{5, 11, 12,13, 15,29,32,33,35,36,39,53,55,56,57,59,77,79},
                  ±{6,7, 17, 18,22,26,27,38,41,46,50,51, 75},
        ±{44,49, 58,61, 62, 63,64,66,67, 68, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74, 76, 78},
    which shows that s(5) 2: 157, is also sum-free mod 158 so that t(5) 2: 157
and t(n) > c(315)n/5 as well.
    Erdos lets f(n) be the smallest integer for which the integers less than
n can be partitioned into f(n) classes so that n is not the sum of dis-
tinct members of the same class. For example, f(l1) = 2, because of
the partition {I, 3, 4, 5, 9}, {2, 6, 7, 8, 1O}, but f(12) = 3. Erdos can prove

E13 Partitioning into strongly sum-free
classes.
'lUran has shown that if the integers [m, 5m + 3] are partitioned into two
classes in any way, then in at least one of them the equation x + y = z is
solvable with x =f y, and that this is not true for the integers [m, 5m + 2].
The uniqueness of the partition of [m, 5m + 2] into two sum-free sets has
been demonstrated by Zmim.
     'lUran also considered the problem where x, yare not necessarily dis-
tinct. Define s(m, n) as the least integer s such that however the interval
 [m, m + s] is partitioned into n classes, one of them contains a solution of
x + y = z. His result corresponding to the first problem is s(m,2) = 4m.
Clearly s(I, n) = s(n) - 1, where s(n) is as in Ell, and Irving's result im-
plies that s(m, n) :::; mln!(e- 2~) -IJ. Abbott & Znam (see Ell) indepen-
dently noted that s(m, n) ~ 3s(m, n-I)+m so that s(m, n) ~ m(3 n -I)j2.
     Abbott & Hanson call a class strongly sum-free if it contains no
solution to either of the equations x + y = z or x + y + 1 = z. They
show that if r(n) is the least r such that however [1, r] is partitioned into
n classes, one of them contains such a solution, then
                  r(m + n) ~ 2r(n)s(m) - r(n) - s(m) + 1.
     They used this to improve the lower bound for s(m, n); their method,
with Fredericksen's example, now gives s(m, n) > cm(3I5)n/5.

E14 Rado's generalizations of van der
Waerden's and Schur's problems.
Rado has considered a number of generalizations of van der Waerden's and
Schur's problems. For example he shows that for any natural numbers a,
b, c, there is a number u so that however the numbers [1, u] are partitioned
into two classes, there is a solution of ax + by = cz in at least one of the
classes. He gives a value for u, but, as in Schur's original problem, this is
not best possible. For example, for 2x + y = 5z, the theorem gives u = 20,
whereas it is true even for u = 15, though not for any smaller value of u:
neither of the sets
                  {I,4,5,6,9,II,I4}      {2,3,7,8, 10, 12, I3}
    contains a solution of 2x + y = 5z. If we are allowed three sets, then
45 is the least value for u, since the following three sets contain all the
328                                   Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

numbers [1,44], even with 6, 7, 8 and 9 duplicated.
         {1,4,5,6,9,11,14,16,19,20,21,24,26,29,31,34,36,39,41,44},
         {2,3, 7,8,1O,12,13,15,17,18,22,23,27,28,32,33,37,38,42,43},
                            {6,7,8,9,25,30,35,40}

     Rado called the equation L: aiXi = 0, where the ai are nonzero integers,
n-fold regular if there is a number u(n), which we can assume to be min-
imal, such that however the interval [1, u(n)J is partitioned into n classes,
at least one class contains a solution to the equation. He called it regular

                °
if it was n-fold regular for all n, and showed that an equation was regular
just if L: aj = for some subset of the ai. For example, if al = a2 = 1
and a3 = -1, we have Schur's original problem with u(n) = s(n). alie and
Abbott considered the problem of finding lower bounds for u(n); see EIO
and Ell for references.
    The example with al = 2, a2 = 1, a3 = -5 is not regular, since,
although we have seen that it is both 2-fold and 3-fold regular, it is not
4-fold regular. For, put every number 5k l, where 5 f l, into just one of four
classes, according as k is even or odd, and l is == ±1 or ±2 mod 5. It can be
verified that none of these four classes contains a solution of 2x + y = 5z.
   Rado asked if there exist, for every k, equations which are k-regular,
but not (k + I)-regular.
   For the equations 2XI + X2 = 2X3 and Xl + X2 + X3 = 2X4, Salie,
Abbott, and Abbott & Hanson obtained successively better lower bounds,
culminating in u(n) > c(12)n/3 and c(1O)n/3 respectively.
   Vera Sos asks for the maximum size of subset of [1, nJ such that Rado's
equation has no solution in the subset. For example if al = a2 = 1 and
a3 = -2, the answer is in the interval [nexp(-Jlnn),nj(lnnY'J. If al =
a2 = 1 and a3 = a4 = -1, we have a Sidon set (compare C9) and the
answer is ~..;n. If al = a2 = 1 and a3 = -1, the answer is nj2. It is
known more generally that the answer is o( n) just if Xl = X2 = ... = 1 is
a solution of Rado's equation. Can the answer ever be comparable to no
with ~ < a < I?

E15 A recursion of Gobel.
F. Gobel has remarked that the recursion Xo = 1,

                 Xn = (1 + x~ + x~ + ... + x~_l)/n               n= 1,2, ...

for a long time, but Hendrik Lenstra found that X43 was not an integer!
   The corresponding sequence with cubes in place of squares holds out
as far as X89. Henry Ibstedt has made extensive calculations, for various
powers k and various initial values ao. The table shows the rank of the
first noninteger member of the sequence

   Raphael Robinson has observed that, in contrast to Gobel's sequence,
the recurrence

            XnXn-k = aXn-pXn-k+p + bXn-qXn-k+q + cxn-rXn-k+r
appears to generate integers from the starting values Xo = Xl = ... = Xk =
1 for any integers a ;:::: 0, b ;:::: 0, c ;:::: 0, p ;:::: 1, q ;:::: 1, r ;:::: 1, k such that
p+q+r = k.
    David Boyd has studied Gobel sequences p-adically, generalizing to the
recurrences Xn = f(n,xn-d where f(n,x) = X + g(x)/n with g(x) a poly-
nomial with integer coefficients. For example, g(x) = x(x - 1) above. He
has an example with g(x) a degree 7 polynomial, and (only!) the first 35530
terms integers.
    Jim Propp reports that combinatorial interpretations have been found

E16 The 3x + 1 problem.
When he was a student, L. Collatz asked if the sequence defined by an+! =
a n /2 (an even), an+! = 3a n + 1 (an odd) is tree-like in structure, apart
from the cycle 4, 2, 1, 4, ... (Figure 16) in the sense that, starting from
any integer al, there is a value of n for which an = 1.
     Erdos has said that "Mathematics may not be ready for such prob-
lems." Do not attempt it without first reading Jeff Lagarias's 1985 article
or visiting Eric Roosendaal's "On the 3x + 1 problem" page.
     In September 2003 a new record replaced that of the previous March.
If al = 255875336134000063, then a maximum of

                  4830857225169174231293987863972468

is attained, but this is still a long way from infinity.
    Shalom Eliahou showed that if the minimum of a cycle is > 240 then its
length is 17087915b + kc for some positive integer b, nonnegative integer c
and k = 301994 or 85137581. Halbeisen & Hungerbiihler sharpen Eliahou's
criterion, and deduce from a computation by Oliviera e Silva, that the 3x+ 1
conjecture is true for integers below 3 . 250, and that any nontrivial cycle
has period length at least 102225496. In September,2003 this lower bound
is at least 630000000.
    Krasikov & Lagarias show by computer-aided proof that at least xO. 84
of the integers < x contain 1 in their forward orbit under the 3x + 1 map.
    Daniel Bernstein shows that the conjecture is equivalent to the follow-
ing: For an increasing sequence of nonnegative integers 0 :::; do < dl < .. .
define two elements in the ring Z2 of 2-adic integers by Q = 2d o + 2d1 + ... ,
N = -.} 2do + ~l2dl + .... Then the function ~(Q) = N is a bijection of Z2
with itself, and he conjectures that the set of positive integers is contained
in ~(G)Z), where Z is the ordinary integers.
    Crandall conjectured that for any odd q > 3, there is an m whose orbit
in the 'qx + 1 problem' does not contain 1. E.g., for q = 5 there is 13, 33,
E. Sequences of Integers                                                331

83, 13 and for q = 181 there is 27, 611, 27. Franco & Pomerance show that
the conjecture is true for almost all q in the sense of asymptotic density.




              Figure 16. Is the Collatz Sequence Tree-like?
   If we iterate the function T(n) = n/2 (n even), (3n+1)/2 (n odd), then
we can define the stopping time, s(n), as the least number k of iterations
that give Tk (n) < n, and the maximum excursion, t( n), as the maximum
value of Tk(n) for k > O. Are s(n) and t(n) always finite? A distributed
computing project at http://personal. computrain. nl/ eric/wondrous
has verified the 3x+ 1 conjecture for n::; 2.52 x 1017 . The lower bound for
the size of a hypothetical new loop is 630 million.
    There is evidence that t(n) < n 2 f(n) where f(n) is either constant
or very slowly increasing. The highest value found for t(n)/n 2 is 7.527 for
n = 3716509988199. For only 7 of the 76 record-holders is the value greater
than one.

    If 3a n + 1 is replaced by 3an - 1 (or if we allow negative integers) then
it seems likely that any sequence concludes with one of the cycles {1,2},
{5,14,7,20,10} or
       {17,50,25, 74,37,110,55,164,82,41,122,61,182,91,272,136,68,34}.
    This is true for all al ::; 108 .
    David Kay and others define the sequence more generally by an+! =
an/p if pin and an+! = anq + r if P f an and asks if there are numbers p, q,
r for which the problem can be settled. For (p,q,r) = (2,5,1) or (2,7,1) it
seems plausible that any sequence will increase rapidly, if erratically, but it
seems to be just as hard to prove anything as it is for the original problem.
The literature is enormous; would-be solvers are urged to study carefully
the writings of Lagarias; see his Amer. Math. Monthly article and the 50-
page annotated bibliography, http://arXiv.org/abs/math/0309224
    Define f (n) to be the largest odd divisor of 3n + 1. Zimian asked if

                                 II ni = II f(ni)
                                 i=l        i=l

holds for any (multi)set {ni} of integers ni > 1. Erdos found that

       65 . 7 . 7 . 11 . 11 . 17 . 17 . 13 = 49 . 11 . 11 . 17 . 17 . 13 . 13 . 5.

    Call an integer n self-contained if n divides fk (n) for some k 2': 1. If
this happens and if the Collatz sequence n* = fk(n)/n reaches 1, then the
set
                    {n, f(n), . .. , fk-l(n), n*, f(n*), ... , I}

is a set such as the above. A computer search for n ::; 104 yielded five
self-contained integers: 31, 83, 293, 347 and 671.
    These mappings are not one-to-one; you can't retrace the history of a
sequence, since there is often no unique inverse.
    Farkas proves that a modified algorithm, in which 3n + 1) /2 is replaced
by (n + 1)/2 when n == 1 (mod 4) and in which powers of 3 are divided
out, always leads to a cycle, e.g.

                 55, 83, 125, 63, 7, 11, 17, 9, 1, 1, 1, ...


   He believes that it also does, even if one is not allowed to divide out
the powers of 3.

E17 Permutation sequences.
The situation is different, though no more clear, in the case of permu-
tation sequences. A simple example, probably the inverse of Collatz's
original problem (see E16 and Lagarias's article cited there), is

                                       an+! = L(3an + 1)/4J       (an odd),

or, perhaps more perspicuously,

           2m -+ 3m       4m -1-+ 3m-1             4m+ 1-+ 3m+ 1

from which it is clear that the inverse operation works just as well. So
the resulting structure consists only of disjoint cycles and doubly infinite
chains. It is not known whether there is a finite or infinite number of each
of these, nor even whether an infinite chain exists. It is conjectured that
the only cycles are {I}, {2,3}, {4,6,9,7,5} and

                {44, 66, 99, 74, 111,83,62,93,70, 105, 79, 59}.

Mike Guy, with the help of TITAN, showed that any other cycles have
period greater than 320. What is the status of the sequence containing the
number 8?

860, 878, 904, 910, 932, 964, 980, ... each belong to a separate sequence?
    There are some intriguing paradoxes: as you go "forward" you multiply
by 3/2 if the current number is even, and by about 3/4 if it's odd - and
get an erratic "pseudo-GP" of common ratio 3/.;8 ~ 1.060660172. On
the other hand, as you go "backward" you multiply by 2/3 if the current
number is a multiple of 3, and by about 4/3 otherwise - a "pseudo-GP" of
common ratio 32 1 / 3 /3 ~ 1.058267368. These two numbers should be recip-
rocal! We have a sort of discrete analog of an everywhere non-differentiable
function. The "derivative" on the right is positive; that on the left is neg-
ative. Note that, when going "forwards" each successor of an even number
is a multiple of 3 - half the numbers are multiples of three!

E1B Mahler's Z-numbers.
Mahler considered the following problem: given any real number a, let rn
be the fractional part of a(3/2)n. Do there exist Z-numbers, for which
           !
o :::; rn < for all n? Probably not. Mahler shows that there is at most
one between each pair of consecutive integers, and that, for x large enough,
at most xO. 7 less than x. Flatto has improved on Mahler's results, but the
problem remains unsolved.
      A similar question is: is there a rational number r / s (s =/: 1) such that
l(r/s)n J is odd for all n? Tijdeman proved that for every odd integer r > 3,
there are real numbers a such that the fractional part of a(r/2)n is in [O,!)
for all n.
      Littlewood once remarked that it was not known that the fractional
part of en did not tend to 0 as n ---- 00.

Forman & Shapiro have proved that infinitely many integers of the form
 l(4/3)n J and also ofthe form l(3/2)n Jare composite. A. L. Whiteman con-
jectures that these two sequences also each contain infinitely many primes.
The method appears not to work for other rationals.

E20 Davenport-Schinzel sequences.
Form sequences from an alphabet [1, n] of n letters such that there are no
immediate repetitions ... aa ... and no alternating subsequences
                           .. . a ... b ... a ... b ...
of length greater than d. Denote by Nd(n) the maximal length of any
such sequence; then a sequence of this length is a Davenport-Schinzel
sequence. The problem is to determine all D-S sequences, and in par-
ticular to find Nd(n). We need only consider normal sequences in which
the first appearance of an integer of the alphabet comes after the first
appearance of every smaller one.
    The sequences 12131323, 12121213131313232323, and
     1 2 1 3141 ... 1 n-ll n-l n-2 ... 32 n 2 n 3 n ... n n-l n
show that N 4 (3) ~ 8, N 8 (3) ~ 20, and N 4 (n) ~ 5n - 8. Davenport
& Schinzel showed that N1(n) = 1, N 2 (n) = n, N 3 (n) = 2n - 1; that
N 4 (n) = O(nlnn/lnlnn), limN4 (n)/n ~ 8 and, with J. H. Conway, that
N 4 (lm + 1) ~ 6lm - m - 51 + 2, so that N 4 (n) = 5n - 8 (4 :::; n :::; 10).
Z. Kolba showed that N 4 (2m) ~ 11m - 13 and Mills obtained the values
of N 4 (n) for n :::; 21. For example, the sequence

         abacadaeafafedcbgbhbhgcicigdjdjgekekgkjihflflhliljlkl

(which, Giinter Rote notes, was misprinted in the first edition) is part of
the proof that N 4 (12) = 53.

   Roselle & Stanton fixed n rather than d and obtained N d (2) = d,
Nd(3) = 2l3d/2J - 4 (d > 3), Nd(4) = 2l3d/2J + 3d - 13 (d > 4) and
Nd(5) = 4l3d/2J +4d-27 (d > 5), though Peterkin observed that this last
parenthesis should be (d > 6) since N 6 (5) = 34. Roselle & Stanton also
showed that normal D-S sequences of length N 2d+1(5) are unique and that
there are just two of length N 2d+1(4) and N2d(5). Peterkin exhibited the
56 D-S sequences of length N 5 (6) = 29 and showed that N 5 (n) 2: 7n - 13
(n > 5) and N 6 (n) 2: 13n - 32 (n> 5).
   Rennie & Dobson gave an upper bound for Nd(n) in the form

 (nd - 3n - 2d + 7)Nd(n) :S n(d - 3)Nd(n - 1) + 2n - d + 2              (d > 3)

thus generalizing the result of Roselle & Stanton for d = 4.

    Szemen3di showed that Nd(n) < cdnlog* n, where log* n is a slow-
growing function, the least number of iterations of the exponential function
needed to exceed n. More recent work, mainly by Sharir, has shown that
the order of Nd(n) is 8(na(n)), where a(n) is the incredibly slow-growing
inverse of the Akermann function. See the paper of Agarwal, Sharir & Shor
for precise details.

E21 Thue-Morse sequences.
Thue showed that there are infinite sequences on 3 symbols which contain
no two identically equal consecutive segments, and sequences on 2 symbols
which contain no three identically equal consecutive segments, and many
others have rediscovered these results.
E. Sequences of Integers                                                     341


    If, instead of identically equal segments, we ask to avoid consecutive
segments which are permutations of one another, Justin constructed a se-
quence on 2 symbols without five consecutive segments which are permu-
tations of each other, and Pleasants constructed a sequence on 5 symbols
without two such consecutive segments. Dekking has solved the (2,4) and
(3,3) problems, and the (4,2) problem has been solved by Keranen.
    Fraenkel & Simpson show that if g(k) is the length of a longest bi-
nary word containing at most k distinct squares (two identical adjacent
substrings), then g(3) = 00.
    Let t be the infinite fixed point, starting with 1, of the morphism JL :
a -+ 01, 1 -+ 10. An infinite word over {0,1} is said to be overlap-free if
it contains no factor of the form axaxa, where a E {a, I} and x E {a, 1}*.
Allouche, Currie & Shallit prove that the lexicographically least infinite
overlap-free binary word beginning with any specified prefix, if it exists,
has a suffix which is a suffix of t. In particular, the lexicographically least
infinite overlap-free binary word is 001001 t.

E22 Cycles and sequences containing all
permutations as subsequences.
Hansraj Gupta asked, for n ~ 2, to find the least positive integer m = m(n)
for which a cycle at, a2, ... , am of positive integers, each :s: n, exists such
that any given permutation of the first n natural numbers appears as a
subsequence (not necessarily consecutive) of


for at least one j, 1 :s: j :s: m. For example, for n = 5, such a cycle is
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 5, so that m(5) :s: 12. He conjectures that
m(n):S: Ln 2 /2J.
    Motzkin & Straus used the ruler function (exponent of the highest
power of 2 which divides k), e.g., n = 5, 1 :s: k s:: 31,
    1,2, 1,3,1,2,1,4,1,2,1,3,1,2,1,5,1,2,1,3,1,2,1,4,1,2,1, 3, 1, 2, 1,
but this doesn't make use of the cyclic options and gives only m( n) :s: 2n-1.


E23 Covering the integers with A.P.s.
If S is the union of n arithmetic progressions, each with common difference
~ k, where k :s: n, Crittenden & Vanden Eynden conjecture that S contains
all positive integers whenever it contains those :s: k2 n -k+l. If this is true,
it's best possible. They have proved it for k = 1 and 2, and Simpson has
proved it for k = 3.

ity sequence if E l/a nbn is irrational for all integer sequences {bn }.
What are the irrationality sequences? Find some interesting ones. If
lim sUp(Iog2 In an) / n > 1, where the log is to base 2, then {an} is an irra-
tionality sequence. {n!} is not an irrationality sequence, because E 1/n! (n+
2) =  !.  Erdos has shown that {22n} is an irrationality sequence. The se-
quence 2,3,7,43,1807, ... , where an+! = a; -an +1, is not an irrationality
sequence, since we may take bn = 1 and the sum of the reciprocals is 1. We
asked about the sequence of alternate terms, 2, 7, 1807, ... and Golomb
showed that the growth rate of 2, 3, 7, 43, 1807, ... is like (pn where
() Rj 1.5979102 so that alternate terms are asymptotic to ()22n and the given

criterion shows that they form an irrationality sequence.
     Analogously, Hanel defines a sequence {an} of positive reals to be a
transcendental sequence if E(ancn)-l is transcendental for every se-
quence {en} of positive integers and shows that {an/b n } is transcendental
if {an}, {bn } are sequences of positive integers satisfying In In an > un and
In In bn < v n for all large n, with u, v real numbers u > v > 3.

E25 Golomb's self-histogramming sequence.
The sequence

     1,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9, ...
defined by f (1) = 1 and f (n) as the number of occurrences of n in a
nondecreasing sequence of integers was attributed to David Silverman in
the first edition. It was given as a problem by Golomb, and solved by him,
by van Lint, and by Marcus & Fine: the asymptotic expression for the n-th
term is indeed T 2-TnT-1 where T is the golden ratio (1 + V5)/2. The error
term E(n) has been investigated by Ilan Vardi, who conjectured that

                                         T-1)
                            E(n) = O± ( ~nn

where E(n) = O±(g(n)) means that there are constants C1, C2 such that
E(n) > c1g(n) and E(n) < -c2g(n) are each true for infinitely n. This has
been proved by Jean-Luc Remy, and he and Petermann have shown that

                       n T- 1 (lnln
                   E(n)=-h     --   n) +0 (nT-I)
                                           -
                        Inn      InT        Inn
where h is a function satisfying h(x) = -h(x + 1) and h not identically o.
    A vaguely similar sequence has been proposed by Lionel Levine, con-
sisting of the last member of each row in the array
     1    1
     1    2
     1    1    2
     1    123
     1    1    1   2   2   3   4
      1   1    1   1   2   2   2   3   3   4    4   5   6   7

in which each row is obtained from the previous one by reading it from right
to left, e.g., read the penultimate line as 'four ones, three twos, two threes,
two fours, one five, one six, one seven'. Sloane knows fifteen members of
the sequence,
   1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, 42, 213, 2837, 175450, 139759600, 6837625106787,
266437144916648607844, 508009471379488821444261986503540
and wonders if the 20th member will ever be calculated.
   A counting sequence is defined as a sequence of sequences {Si}~O of
positive integers. The sequence Si+1 is obtained from Si by counting the
number mk of times an integer k occurs in Si and writing down in Si+!
the pair (mk, k) in increasing order of k, for all k for which mk > O. See
the Sauerberg & Shu paper.

    Marshall Hall proved the existence of Ii sequence such that every positive
integer occurs uniquely as the difference of two members of the sequence.
For example,

 1,2,4,8,16,21,42,51,102,112,224,235,470,486,972,990,1980,2001, ...
defined by al = 1, a2 = 2, a2n+l = 2a2n, a2n+2 = a2n+l + r n , where
r n is the least natural number which cannot be represented in the form
aj - ai with 1 :5 i < j :5 2n + 1. There are other possible sequences, but
the problem of finding the ones with smallest asymptotic growth remains
open.

E26 Epstein's Put-or-Take-a-Square game.
Richard Epstein's Put-or-Take-a-Square game is played with one heap of
beans. Two players play alternately. A move is to add or subtract the
largest perfect square number of beans that is in the heap. That is, the
two players alternately name nonnegative integers an, where



the winner being the first to name zero. This is a loopy game and many
numbers lead to a draw. For example, from 2 the next player will not take
1, allowing his opponent to win, so she does to 3. Now to add 1 is a bad
move, so her opponent goes back to 2. Similarly 6 leads to a draw with
best play: 6, 10, 19!, 35, 60, 109!, 209!, 13!, 22!, 6, ... , where! means a
good move, not factorial!
    For example, 405 is a bad move after 209, since the next player can go
to 5 which is a P-position (previous player winning). Similarly, from 60,
it is bad to go to 11, an N-position , one in which the next player can
win (by going to 20).
     Do either of the sequences of P-positions

     0,5,20,29,45,80, 101, 116, 135, 145, 165, 173,236,257,397,

     949,954,975,1125,1177, ...

or of N-positions

     1, 4, 9, 11, 14, 16, 21, 25, 30, 36, 41, 44, 49, 52, 54, 64, 69, 71,

E27 Max and mex sequences.
In his master's thesis, Roger Eggleton discussed max sequences, in which
a given finite sequence aQ, aI, ... , an is extended by defining an+l =
maxi(ai + an-i). One of the main results is that the first differences are
ultimately periodic. For example, starting from 1, 4, 3, 2 we get 7, 8, 11,
12,15,16, ... with differences 3, -1, -1,5,1,3,1,3,1, .... What happens
350                                      Unsolved Problems in Number Theory


to mex sequences, where the mex of a set of nonnegative integers is the
minimum excluded number, or least nonnegative integer which does not
appear in the set? Now the sequence 1,4, 3, 2 continues
  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, ....
Are such sequences ultimately periodic?
    A. S. Fraenkel is reminded of the sequence ai = lio:J, where 0: is any
real number, which satisfies the inequalities

                                                      1 ::; i < n,     n = 2,3, ....

E.g., 0: = ~(1 + V5) generates the sequence 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16,
17, 19, 21, ... which complements that for bi = li,BJ, where 1/0: + 1/,B = 1.
These Beatty sequences combine to form Wythoff pairs.
    Motivation for this problem comes from the analysis of octal games
using the Sprague-Grundy theory, where ordinary addition is replaced by
nim addition, i.e., addition in base 2 without carry, or XOR. The behavior
of such sequences remains a considerable mystery, clarification of which
would lead to results about nim-like games.

E28 B 2-sequences. Mian-Chowla sequences.
Call an infinite sequence 1 ::; al < a2 < ... an A-sequence if no ai is the
sum of distinct members of the sequence other than ai. Erdos proved that
for every A-sequence, L: l/ai < 103, and Levine and O'Sullivan improved
this to 4. They also gave an A-sequence whose sum of reciprocals is> 2.035.
Abbott, and later Zhang, have given the example

           {I, 2, 4, 8,1 + 24k, 35950 + 24t : 1 ::; k ::; 55, 0::; t ::; 44}

which improves this to 2.0648. A further block of terms will push this past
2.0649, but not as far as 2.065.

    If 1 :::; al < a2 < ... is a B 2 -sequence (compare C9), i.e., a sequence
where all the sums of pairs ai + aj are different, what is the maximum of
I: l/ai? There are two problems, according as i = j is permitted or not,
but Erdos was unable to solve either of them.
    The most obvious B 2-sequence is that obtained by the greedy algo-
rithm (compare EIO). Each term is the least integer greater than earlier
terms which does not violate the distinctness of sums condition; i = j is
permitted:
          1,2,4,8,13,21,31,45,66,81,97,123,148,182, ....
Mian & Chowla used this to show the existence of a B 2-sequence with ak «
k 3 • If M is the maximum of I: 1/ai over all B2 -sequences and S* is the sum
of the reciprocals of the Mian-Chowla sequence, then M ~ S* > 2.156. But
Levine observes that if tn = n(n + 1)/2, then M :::; I: l/(t n + 1) < 2.374,
and asks if M = S*? Zhang disproves this by showing that S* < 2.1596
and M > 2.1597. The latter result is obtained by replacing the next term,
204, in the Mian-Chowla sequence, by 229, and then continuing with the
greedy algorithm.
     Let al < a2 < ... be an infinite sequence of integers for which all the
triple sums ai + aj + ak are distinct. Erdos offers $500.00 for a proof or
disproof of an old conjecture of his, that liman /n 3 = 00.
     Let K(m) = max(m - ~) over all m-element B 2-sequences. Zhang
Zhen-Xiang finds lower bounds for K(P) when p is prime; e.g., K(829) >
10.279. The steady growth of these lower bounds suggests that the Erdos-
Thran conjecture K(m) = 0(1) may be false.

E29 Sequence with sums and products all in
one of two classes.
Partition the integers into two classes. Is it true that there is always a
sequence {ai} so that all the sums E €iai and all the products II a: i where
the €i are 0 or 1 with all but a finite number zero, are in the same class?
Hindman answered this question of ErdOs negatively.
    Is there a sequence al < a2 < ... so that all the sums ai + aj and
products aiaj are in the same class? Graham proved that if we partition
the integers [1,252] into two classes, there are four distinct numbers x,
y, x + y and xy all in the same class. Moreover, 252 is best possible.
Hindman proved that if we partition the integers [2,990] into two classes,
then one class always contains four distinct numbers x, y, x + y and xy.
No corresponding result is known for the integers;::: 3.
    Hindman also proved that if we partition the integers into two classes,
there is always an infinite sequence {ai} so that all the sums ai + aj (i = j
permitted) are in the same class. On the other hand he found a decompo-
sition into three classes so that no such infinite sequence exists.

E30 MacMahon's prime numbers of
measurement.
MacMahon's "prime numbers of measurement,"

       1,2,4,5,8,10,14,15,16,21,22,25,26,28,33,34,35,36,38,40,42, ...

are generated by excluding all the sums of two or more consecutive earlier
members of the sequence.
    If mn is the nth member of the sequence, and Mn is the sum of the
first n members, then George Andrews conjectures that

   "     mn rv n(1nn)jlnlnn   ?   and    "   Mnrvn2(1nn)jln(lnn)2        ?
E. Sequences of Integers                                                   353

and poses the following, presumably easier, problems: prove limn-Amn =
o for some ~ < 2; prove lim mn/n = 00; prove mn < Pn for every n, where
Pn is the nth prime.
    Jeff Lagarias suggests excluding only the sums of two or three consecu-
tive earlier members, and asked if the resulting sequence
       1,2,4,5,8,10,12,14,15,16,19,20,21,24,25,27,28,32,33,34,
       37,38,40,42,43,44,46,47,48,51,53,54,56,57,58,59,61, ...
has density ~. DOll Coppersmith has a better heuristic, suggesting that
the answer is 'no.'
    More generally, if 1 ::; al < a2 < ... < ak ::; n is a sequence in which no
a is the sum of consecutive earlier members, then Pomerance found that
           nt
max k ~ l 3 J and Robert Freud later showed that max k ~ ~~ n. They
notice, with Erdos, that max k ::; ~n, even if we only forbid sums of two
consecutive earlier members. Coppersmith & Phillips have since shown
that maxk ~ ~~n - 0(1) and they lower the upper bound to

                          2                                     1
                maxk::; ("3 - E)n + O(lnn)    with       E =   896'

   Erdos asks if the lower density of the sequence is zero; perhaps

                                                     ?

E31 Three sequences of Hofstadter.
Doug Hofstadter has defined three intriguing sequences.
354                                    Unsolved Problems in Number Theory


      (a)al = a2 = 1 and an = an-an_l + an-a n_2 for n ~ 3. What is the
         general behavior of this sequence?
                  1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 10, 9, 10, 11, 11,
                12,12,12,12,16,14,14,16,16,16,16, 20, 1~ 1~ ...
         Are there infinitely many integers 7, 13, 15, 18, ... that get
         missed out?
    (b) bl = 1, b2 = 2 and for n ~ 3, bn is the least integer greater than
         bn - l which can be expressed as the sum oftwo or more consecutive
         terms of the sequence, so it goes
              1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 1~ 16, 1~ 18, 19, 21, 22, 2~ 25, 2~
                30,32,33,34,35,37,40,41,43,45,46,47,49,51, ...
         This is a sort of dual of MacMahon's prime numbers of measure-
         ment (E30). How does the sequence grow?
    (c) CI = 2, C2 = 3, and when CI, ... , Cn are defined, form all possible
         expressions
         CiCj - 1 (1:S; i < j :s; n) and append them to the sequence:
              2, 3, 5, 9, 14, 17, 26, 27, 33, 41, 44, 50, 51, 53, 65, 69, 77,
                   80,81,84,87,98,99,101,105,122,125,129, ...
         Does the result include almost all of the integers?
    A similar sequence to the first of these three was given by Conway:
                1,1,2, 2,3,4, ~ 4, 5, 6, ~ ~ ~ 8, 8, 8, 9, ...
defined, for n ~ 3, by
                    a(n) = a(a(n - 1)) + a(n - a(n - 1)).

The difficult questions were answered in an entertaining paper by Mallows.
Several identities have been obtained by Zeitlin. A variation is to define

                  b(n) = b(b(n - 1» + b(n - 1 - b(n - 1»,

but this is related to the previous sequence by b( n - 1) = n - a( n). But if
we write
                     c(n) = c(c(n - 2» + c(n - c(n - 2»
then the increments become very irregular, and it is not even clear that
c(n)/n tends to a limit.
   Higham & Tanny observe that the variant defined by

              e{n) = e{n - 1 - e{n - 1» + e{n - 2 - e{n - 2»

with k ~ 4 initial values Li /2 J, 0 :s; i < k is well behaved.

E32 B 2-sequences from the greedy algorithm.
An old problem of Dickson is still unsolved. Given a set of k integers, al <
a2 < ... < ak, define an+! for n 2: k as the least integer greater than an
                              +
which is not of the form ai aj, i, j ~ n. Except for the prescribed section
356                                      Unsolved Problems in Number Theory

at the beginning of the sequence, these are sum-free sequences formed by
the greedy algorithm (compare C9, C14, ElO, E28).
    Is the sequence of differences an+l - an ultimately periodic?
    Such sequences may take a long time before the periodicity appears.
For example, even for k = 2, if we take al = 1, a2 = 6, the sequence is
      1,6,8,10,13,15,17,22,24,29,31,33,36,38,40,45,47,52,54,56,59,61,63,68, ...
and one can be forgiven for not immediately recognizing the pattern. Try
starting with the set {1,4,9,16,25}; after 82 irregular differences, it settles
down to a period of length 224.
    Queneau (see reference at C4) considered the similar problem with
i < j ~ n in place of i, j ~ n. Such O-additive sequences have also
been conjectured to have ultimately periodic differences. Steven Finch has
calculated 1 ~ million terms of the sequence whose first 6 terms are given
as {3, 4, 6, 9,10, 17} without detecting any sign of ultimate periodicity of
the differences.
    Selmer tells me that Dickson's problem is the particular case h = 2 of
Stohr sequences : let al = 1 and define an+! for n 2: k to be the least
integer greater than an which can not be written as the sum of at most
h addends among aI, a2, ... , an. Compare the h-bases of C12. In;the
great majority of cases, the sequence of differences an+! - an turns out to
be ultimately periodic, but there are a few of the examined cases where
periodicity has not been established.
    Calkin & Erdos show that certain natural aperiodic sum-free sets are
incomplete in the sense that there are infinitely many n not in Swhich are
not the sum of two elements in S. They note that the reference to Dickson
does not contain the problem ascribed to him.
   Compare C14, E12.

E33 Sequences containing no monotone A.P.s.
Erdos & Graham say that a sequence {ai} has a monotone A.P. of length
k if there are subscripts i 1 < i2 < ... < ik such that the subsequence aij'
1 :S j :S k is either an increasing or a decreasing A.P. If M (n) is the number
of permutations of [1, n] which have no monotone 3-term A.P., then Davis
et al have shown that
      M{n) ~ 2n - 1      M{2n - 1) :S (n!)2       M{2n) :S (n + 1){n!)2
They ask if M{n)l/n is bounded.
    Davis et al have also shown that any permutation of (all) the positive
integers must contain an increasing 3-term A.P., but there are permutations
with no monotone 5-term A.P. It is not known whether a monotone 4-term
A.P. must always occur.
    If the positive integers are arranged as a doubly-infinite sequence then
a monotone 3-term A.P. must still occur, but it's possible to prevent the
occurrence of 4-term ones.
    If all the integers are to be permuted then Tom Odda has shown that no
7-term A.P. need occur in the singly-infinite case, but little else is known.

E34 Happy numbers.
Reg. Allenby's daughter came home from school in Britain with the concept
of happy numbers. The problem may have originated in Russia. If
you iterate the process of summing the squares of the decimal digits of a
number, then it's easy to see that you either reach the cycle
              4 -+ 16 -+ 37 -+ 58 -+ 89 -+ 145 -+ 42 -+ 20 -+ 4
358                                     Unsolved Problems in Number Theory


or arrive at 1. In the latter case you started from a happy number. The
first hundred happy numbers are
   1 7 10 13 19 23 28 31 32 44 49 68 70 79 82 86 91 94 97 100
  103 109 129 130 133 139 167 176 188 190 192 193 203 208 219 226 230 236 239 262
  263 280 291 293 301 302 310 313 319 320 326 329 331 338 356 362 365 367 368 376
  379383386391392397404409440446464469478487490496536 556 563 565
  566 608 617 622 623 632 635 637 638 644 649 653 655 656 665 671 673 680 683 694

It seems that about 1/7 of all numbers are happy, but what bounds on
the density can be proved? How many consecutive happy numbers can
you have? Can there be arbitrarily many? The first pair is 31, 32; the
first triple is 1880, 1881, 1882 and an example of five consecutive happy
numbers is 44488, 44489, 44490, 44491, 44492. Jud McCranie finds that
the first quadruple of happy numbers ends with 7842, and that the first
quintuple is the one above. He found no sextuples below 1012 . However,
Allenby tells me that Hendrik Lenstra can show that there are arbitrarily
long sequences of consecutive happy numbers.
    How large can the gaps be in the sequence of happy numbers? We can
define the height of a happy number to be the number of iterations needed
to reach 1. For example, the least happy numbers of

                  height
                   are
                             °
                             1
                                   1
                                  10
                                        2
                                       13
                                             3
                                            23
                                                 4
                                                 19
                                                       5
                                                       7
                                                             6
                                                            356.

   McCranie verifies that 78999 is the least happy number of height 7,
that that of height 8 is the 977-digit number 37889999999 ... 999, and that
that of height 9 has about 10977 digits. Warut Roonguthai confirms these
results and gives the last as

                           78889.10(421-10973 -34)/9 - 1,

a number of (421 . 10973 + 11)/9 decimal digits.
    How big is the least happy number of height h ?

                                                                    °
    If we replace squares by cubes, then the situation is dominated, at least
in base 10, by the fact that perfect cubes are congruent to or ±1 mod

                                         °
9. The density of the corresponding numbers (1, 10, 100, 112, 121, 211,
778, . .. ) may be zero. Numbers == mod 3 converge to 153 and numbers
== 2 mod 3 converge to 371 or 407, so that interest is confined to numbers
== 1 mod 3. These converge to 370, or to one of the two 3-cycles (55, 250,
133) or (160, 217, 352), or to one of the two 2-cycles (919, 1459) or (136,
244), or, just occasionally, to 1. What proportion goes to each?
    Somjit Datta considers fourth and fifth powers. For fourth powers he
notes that about 8/9 of the numbers < 104 converge to the 7-cycle (1138,
4179, 9219, 13139, 6725, 4339, 4514), about 1 in 23 to the 2-cycle (2178,
6514) and the rest, apart from powers of 10, converge to 8208.

   For powers of five he found 12 nontrivial cycles: with cycle lengths

   The appearance of (4150,4151) and (9044,9045) is intriguing. What of
higher powers? And different bases? Some results are given by Grundman

the main diagonal element, and then reading the first number after the box,
the first before the box, the second after the box, the second before the box,

which displays a similar chaotic behavior.
    In each array there's a small amount of pattern: some knight's move
arithmetic progressions of common difference 3. For example, in the orig-
inal array, for each y ~ 0, the number n + 3y is in position 2y + 1 on row
x + y, where, for each t ~ 0,

          n = 9· 2t - 3t - 7,   12· 2t - 3t - 8,   resp.   15· 2t - 3t - 9
when      x = 3 . 2t - 1,       4· 2t - 1,         resp.   5 . 2t - 1

so that n + 3y is expelled on row 2x - 1 = 2y + 1. I.e.,

          n =     18· 2t - 3t - 13, 24· 2t - 3t - 14, resp. 30· 2t - 3t - 15

E37 Mousetrap.
Cayley introduced a permutation problem he called Mousetrap which is
loosely based on the card game Treize. Suppose that the numbers 1,2, ... ,n
are written on cards, one to a card. After shuffling (permuting) the cards,
start counting the deck from the top card down. If the number on the card
does not equal the count, transfer the card to the bottom of the deck and
continue counting. If the two are equal then set the card aside and start
counting again from 1. The game is won if all the cards have been set
aside, but lost if the count reaches n + 1. Cayley proposed two questions.
1. For each n find all the winning permutations of 1,2, ... , n.
2. For each n find the number of permutations that eliminate precisely i
cards for each i, 1 :::; i :::; n.
    A third question arose during our investigations. Consider a permu-
tation for which every number is set aside. The list of numbers in the
order that they were set aside is another permutation. Any permutation
obtained in this way we call a reformed permutation.
3. Characterize the reformed permutations.
    The permutation 4213 is a winning permutation which gives rise to the
permutation 2134; this in turn gives the reformed permutation 3214 which
is not a winning permutation.
4. For a given n, what is the longest sequence of reformed permutations?
5. Are there sequences of arbitrary length? Are there any cycles other

than
           1 --+ 1 --+ 1 --+ 1 . . .   and     12 --+ 12 --+ 12 --+ 12 ... ?
    Modular Mousetrap. We can play Mousetrap, but instead of count-
ing n, n + 1, ... , we can start again, ... , n, 1, 2, .... Now at least
as many cards get set aside. In fact if n is prime, then either the initial
deck is a derangement, or all cards get set aside, so every sequence cycles
or terminates in a derangement. The identity permutation 123 ... n will
always form a 1-cycle and now there are also examples of nontrivial cycles.

6. Are there k-cycles for every k? What is the least value of n which
yields a k-cycle?

E38 Odd sequences
Call a sequence of n zeros and ones, {aI, ... , an}, odd if each of the n sums
L.~:lk aiaHk, (k = 0, 1, ... ,n -1) is odd. For example, 1101 is odd. It was
thought that there were no odd sequences if n ~ 5, but Peter Alles showed
that there are infinitely many: if 0 is an odd sequence of length n and x
and z are sequences of n - 1 and 3n - 2 zeros, then oxozo and ozoxo are
odd sequences of length 7n - 3. For

odd sequences and no others with n ~ 50. For example, 101011100011 and
its reversal. He asks if n is always congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4, and if,
E. Sequences of Integers                                                    363


when there are odd sequences, they are always a power of two in number.
Adam Sikora reported that he has answered both of these questions in the
affirmative, but he was anticipated by Inglis & Wiseman, who show further
that there is an odd sequence of length n > 1 just if the order of 2 is odd
in the multiplicative group of integers modulo 2n - 1. However, all these
people were anticipated by MacWilliams & Odlyzko in 1977.
    Pieter Moree has written:
                 . .. an odd sequence of length n exists if and only
     if there exists a [2n, nJ extended binary cyclic code, the cele-
     brated [24,12, 8J Golay code arising in that way for n = 12.
     Alles's results and questions have previously been established
     by MacWilliams and Odlyzko in 1977, furthermore they gave a
     simple characterization of the n for which odd sequences exist:
         Theorem. A sequence of length n is odd if and only if
     2n - 1 is in P, where P is a set having the following properties:
         (i) An integer r belongs to P if and only if all the prime
     factors of r belong to P.
         (ii) If p is a prime, then pEP if and only if p divides 228 +1_1
     for some Sj in other words if and only if expp (2) is odd, where
     expp(a) is the smallest integer m such that am == 1 mod p. 0
         This implies that if p == -1 mod 8, then PEP, and if
     p == ±3 mod 8, then p ~ P. Moreover, from their proof it is
     clear that if there exists odd sequences of length n, they can be
     constructed easily, and that their number is a power of 2. This
     solves Question (ii) posed by Alles.
         The last part of the theorem leaves open the behaviour of
     the primes p == 1 mod 8. Sometimes they turn out to be in P
     and sometimes not. Let 7rp(x) denote the number of primes in
     P not exceeding x. MacWilliams and Odlyzko stated that they
     could prove that 7rp(x) '" (7/24)7r(x) as x ----> 00, where 7r(x)
     denotes the number of primes not exceeding x. Theorem 2 of
     Wiertelak implies the stronger result:

                             7            (X(lnlnx)4)
                   7rp(x) = 24 7r (x) + 0    (lnx)3   .

     From the theorem it follows that if an odd sequence of length
     n exists, then n == 0 mod 4 or n == 1 mod 4. This answers
     Question (i) of Alles. From the theorem and the fact that
     23 == 1 mod 7, it follows that if 2n - 1 E P, then 7(2n - 1) E P.
     Thus if there is an odd sequence of length n, then there also
     must be an odd sequence of length 7n - 3. This observation
     was used by Alles to prove that there are infinitely many odd
     sequences. Indeed, the above display combined with Theorem
364                                    Unsolved Problems in Number Theory


       4 of my preprint (referred to below) allows one to make this
       much more precise. Let N(x) be the number of odd sequences
       of length not exceeding x. Then, as x -+ 00,

                               x    (      ((lnlnX)5))
                 N(x) = c (lnx)17/24 1 + 0     lnx     '

       where c is a positive constant.
Moree also adds:
       If K is a field then the minimal number, s(K), if it exists,
       of elements of K such that -1 = a~ + ... + a~ is called the
       Stufe (level) of K. For m ~ 3 let Km := Q(e 21l"im). Hilbert
       has proved that the Stufe of such a field is either 1, 2 or 4.
       From MacWilliams & Odlyzko and the results of Fein, Gordon
       & Smith it follows that for m ~ 2, K 2m - 1 has Stufe 4 if and
       only if there exists an odd sequence of length m.
     Moree & Sole conjecture that if S(n) is the number of odd sequences
of length n, then, for each e ~ 1, there are infinitely many n for which
S(n) = 2e . Under the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis, they prove that
this is true if 2e + 1 is not a prime == 5 mod 8. If Ne(x) is the number of
n:::; x for which S(n) = 2e , and r(e) = maxwI(2n -1) taken over such n,
where WI is the number of prime divisors occurring only to the first power,
then they also conjecture that if r(e) ~ 1, then there is a constant Ce such
that

Fl GauB's lattice point problem.
A very difficult unsolved problem is Gausss problem@GauB's problem.
How many lattice points are there inside the circle with centre at the origin
and radius r? If the answer is 7rr2 + h(r), then Hardy & Landau showed
that h(r) is not o(r 1/ 2 (ln r)1/4). It is conjectured that h(r) = O(rl/2+f).
Iwaniec & Mozzochi have shown that h(r) = O(r7/1Hf), and the best
that was known was h(r) = O(r 46 / 73+ f ), by Huxley. But see his recent
article in Number Theory for the Millenium where the exponent is improved
to 131/208; and the corresponding exponent for the divisor problem is
131/416. Here, Dirichlet's divisor problem is to estimate the error, ~(x),
in the formula
                     x
                    L d(n) = x In x + (2')' - 1)x + ~(x)

the rectangular hyperbola.
    One can ask analogous questions in three dimensions for the sphere and
regular tetrahedron. For the rectangular tetrahedron of F22 see the paper
of Lehmer and also that of Xu & Yau, but their suggested counterexample
to Overhagen's upper bound for arbitrary convex bodies is incorrect.
    The corresponding problems with cubes or higher powers in place of
squares has also attracted much attention. See the literature quoted below.

F2 Lattice points with distinct distances.
What is the largest number k, of lattice points (x, y), 1 ~ x, Y ~ n, which
can be chosen so that their (~) mutual distances are all distinct? It is easy
to see that k ~ n. This bound can be attained for n ~ 7, for example for
n = 7 with the points (1,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,7), (4,1), (6,6) and (7,7), but
not for any larger value of n. Erdos & Guy showed that
                         n 2/ 3- E < k < en/(ln n)1/4
and they conjecture that
                                                      ?

    One can also ask for "saturated" configurations, containing a minimum
number of points which determine distinct distances, but such that no
lattice point may be added without duplicating a distance. Erdos observes
that this needs at least n 2 / 3 - £ lattice points. In one dimension he cannot
improve on O(n 1/ 3) and suspects that O(nl/2+£) is best possible.

25(1970) 121-123; MR 43 #7406.


F3 Lattice points, no four on a circle.
Erdos & Purdy ask how many of the n 2 lattice points (x, y), 1:::; x, y :::; n
can you choose with no four of them on a circle. It is easy to show n 2 / 3 -£,
but more should be possible.

          m
    What is the smallest t so that you can choose t of the lattice points so
that the      lines that they determine contain all the n 2 lattice points? It
is not hard to show t > cn 2 / 3 and Noga Alon has since obtained the bounds
               cnd (d-l)/(2d-l) :::; t(n, d) :::; Cnd(d-l)/(2d-l) In n

for the problem in any number, d, of dimensions.

F4 The no-three-in-line problem.
The no-three-in-line problem. Can 2n lattice points (x, y) with
(1'::; x, Y :::; n) be selected with no three in a straight line? This has
been achieved for 2 :::; n ::; 32 and for several larger even values of n. Guy
& Kelly make four conjectures.
   L There are no configurations with the symmetry of a rectangle which
     do not have the full symmetry of the square.
   2. The only configurations having the full symmetry of the square are
      those in Figure 17. The n = 10 configuration was first found by
      Acland-Hood. This conjecture has been verified by Flammenkamp
      for n:::; 60.
   3. For large enough n, the answer to the initial question is "no," i.e.,
      there are only finitely many solutions to the problem. The total
      number of configurations, not counting reflexions and rotations, is,
      for

     and the configurations with specific symmetries have been enumer-
     ated for larger values of n.
  4. For large n we may select at most (c+E)n lattice points with no three
     in line, where 3c3 = 27[2, i.e. C ~ 1.85. As recently as March, 2004,
     Gabor EHmann notes an error in the original paper, so that the result
     can be impoved to: 3c2 = 7[2, C ~ 1.813799.
    In the opposite direction, Erdos showed that if n is prime, it is possible
to choose n points with no three in line, and HaH et al have shown that for
n large, (~ - E)n such points can be found.

   T. Thiele modifies Erdos's construction to show that one can find
G- €)n points with no 3 in line and no 4 on a circle.
    The no-three-in-line problem is a discrete analog of an old problem of
Heilbronn. Place n (~ 3) points in a disk (or square, or equilateral triangle)
of unit area so as to maximize the smallest area of a triangle fromed by
three of the points. If we denote this maximum area by d(n), then Heil-
bronn originally conjectured that d(n) < c/n 2 , but Koml6s, Pintz & Sze-
meredi disproved this by showing that d(n) > (In n) / n 2 • Roth showed that
d(n) « l/n(1nln n)1/2 j Schmidt improved this to d(n) « l/n(ln n)1/2 and
Roth subsequently made the further improvement d(n) « l/nP--', first
with J.t = 2 - 2/v5 > 1.1055 and later with J.t = (17 - J65)/8 > 1.1172.
    Given 3n points in the unit square, n ~ 2, they determine n triangles
in many ways. Choose them so as to minimize the sum of the areas,
and let a* (n) be the maximum value of this minimum sum, taken over all
configurations of 3n points. Then Odlyzko & Stolarsky show that n- 1/ 2 «
a*(n) « n- 1/ 24 . If the n triangles are required to be area disjoint it is not
even clear that the sum of their areas tends to zero.

F5 Quadratic residues. Schur's conjecture.
The quadratic residues of a prime p are the nonzero numbers r for which
the congruence r == x 2 mod p has solutions. There are ~ (p - 1) of them
in the interval [l,p - 1] and they are symmetrically distributed if p is of
shape 4k + 1. If p = 4k - 1, there are more quadratic residues in the
interval [1, 2k - 1] than in [2k, 4k - 2], but all known proofs use Dirichlet's
class-number formula. Is there an elementary proof?
    For the first few values of d it is easy to remember which primes have
d as a quadratic residue:

             d= -1   p = 4k + 1
             d= -2   p= 8k+ 1,3              d=2       p = 8k± 1
             d= -3   p = 6k + 1              d=3       P = 12k ± 1
             d= -5   P = 20k + 1,3,7,9       d=5       p = 10k ± 1
             d= -6   P = 24k + 1,5,7,11      d=6       p = 24k ± 1,5

However, it's just an example of the Law of Small Numbers that in these
small cases the residues are just those in the first half or the end quarters
of the period, according to the sign of d.
    That there are equally many residues as nonresidues in the interval
[1,2, ... ,2k] for primes 8k + 3 and in the interval [2k, 2k + 1, ... , 4k - 1]
for primes 8k - 1 was proved by Lebesgue.
    The Legendre symbol, (~), is often used to indicate the quadratic
character of a number a, a 1- p, relative to the prime p. Its value is
±1 according as a is, or is not, a quadratic residue of p. For example,
(-;,1)  = ±1 according as p = 4k ± 1. The important properties of this

symbol are that (~) = (~) if a == c mod p; and GauE's famous quadratic
reciprocity law, that for odd primes p and q, (~)              (~) unless p and
q are both == -1 mod 4, in which case (~) = - (~). These can be used
for making quick verifications of the quadratic character of quite large
numbers. For example,

(211   173 (38)

     Robin Chapman has a number of conjectures which concern the distri-
bution of the quadratic residues. For example, if p = 2k + 1 is a prime > 3
and == 3 (mod 4) is the matrix whose (i,j)-th entry is (~) singular? i.e.,
is its determinant zero? For example, p = 11, k = 5,
                       -1     1     1     1    -1
                        1     1     1    -1    -1
                        1     1    -1    -1    -1    =0
                        1    -1    -1    -1     1
                       -1    -1    -1     1    -1
   A useful generalization of the Legendre symbol is the Jacobi symbol
(%) which is defined for a ..1 b and b any positive odd number, by the
product

                                   rr(;J
of Legendre symbols, where b = II Pi is the prime factorization of b, with
repetitions counted. It has similar properties to the Legendre symbol, but
note that, if b is not prime, then (%) = +1 does not necessarily imply that
a is a quadratic residue of b.
    If R (respectively N) is the maximum number of consecutive quadratic
residues (respectively nonresidues) modulo an odd prime p, then A. Brauer
showed that for p == 3 mod 4, R = N < .;p. On the other hand, if p = 13,
then N = 4 > v'13, since 5, 6, 7, 8 are all nonresidues of 13. Schur
conjectured that N < .;p if p is large enough. Hudson proved Schur's
conjecture; moreover, he believes that p = 13 is the only exception; this
was recently proved by Hummel. Calculations by Jud McCranie suggest
that N = O(pl/4).
    Fletcher, Lindgren & Pomerance say that two odd primes p, q form a
symmetric pair if the numbers of lattice points above and below the main
diagonal of the rectangle (0,0), (P/2,0); (P/2, q/2), (0, q/2) are equal, and
call a prime symmetric if it belongs to a symmetric pair and asymmet-
ric otherwise. They show that twin primes form symmetric pairs. They
note that about 5/6 of the first 100000 odd primes are symmetric, but,
asymptotically, almost all primes are asymmetric.
    Ribet asks for a discussion of the function S(p)/p, where S(P) is the
sum of the quadratic residues, mod p.

F6 Patterns of quadratic residues.
What patterns of quadratic residues are sure to occur? It is easy to see
that a pair of neighboring ones always do, since at least one of 2, 5 and 10
is a residue, so that (1,2), (4,5) or (9,10) is such a pair. In the same way
at least one of (1,3), (2,4) or (4,6) is a pair of residues differing by 2; (1,4)
is a pair differing by 3; (1,5), (4,8), (6,10) or (12,16) is a pair differing by
4; and so on.
     Suppose that each of r, r + a, r + b is a quadratic residue modulo p.
Emma Lehmer asks: for which pairs (a, b) will such a triplet occur for all
sufficiently large p? Denote by O(a, b) the least number such that a triplet
is assured with r ~ O(a, b) for all p > p(a, b), and write O(a, b) = 00 if
there is no such finite number. For example, Emma Lehmer showed that
0(1,2) = 00, and more generally that O(a, b) = 00 if (a, b) == (1,2) mod 3;
or if (a, b) == (1,3), (2,3) or (2,4) mod 5; or if (a, b) == (1,5), (2,3) or (4,6)
mod 7. Is O(a, b) finite in all other cases? Emma Lehmer conjectures that
it is finite if a and b are squares. Of course, O(a, b) = 1 if a, b are each
one less than a square. As an example, let us see why 0(5,23) = 16. If
the triplets (1,6,24) and (4,9,27) are not all residues then 6 and 3 are not,
and 2 must be a residue. If the triplets (2,7,25) and (13,18,36) are not all
residues, then 7 and 13 must be nonresidues. Under these circumstances,
(r, r + 5, r + 23) are not all residues for 1 ~ r ~ 15, but when r = 16,
(16,21,39) are residues.
     Table 9, with nine entries corrected by Chris Thompson, contains what
are believed to be the (minimum) values of O(a, b). They provide good
evidence for the conjectured finiteness in all cases except those already
noted. Can an upper bound be obtained in terms of a and b?

    What about patterns of four residues, r, r + a, r + b, r + c? Of course
these won't necessarily occur if any of the four subpatterns of three residues
aren't forced to do so. We need examine only (a, b, c) = (2,5,6), (1,6,7),
(1,4,9), (5,6,9), (1,6,10), (1,7,10), ... where O(a, b), O(a, c), O(b, c) and
O(b - a, c - a) are each known to be finite. Some corresponding values of
O(a, b, c) are 0(1,4,9) = 357 (Peter Montgomery corrects an error in the
first edition), 0(1,4,15) = 675, and of course 0(3,8,15) = 1.
     But although 0(1,6) = 24, 0(1,7) = 38, 0(5,6) = 49 and 0(6,7) = 57,
it appears that 0(1,6,7) = 00. In fact the pattern r, r+a, r+b, r+c, r+d,
with (a, b, c, d) = (1,6,7,10) is such that, for each of the five subpatterns
of four, 0(1,6,7) = 0(1,6,10) = 0(1,7,10) = 0(5,6,9) = 0(6,7,10) = 00.
376                                    Unsolved Problems in Number Theory


   It is customary to define k-th power residues as numbers r for which
xk == r mod p has a solution, only with respect to those primes for which
k divides p - 1. In the same way that we remarked that every prime > 10
has a pair of consecutive quadratic residues not exceeding the pair (9,10),
Hildebrand has shown that for each k there is a fixed bound, A(k, 2) so that
every sufficiently large prime has a pair of consecutive k-th power residues
below this bound. There is no such bound for 3 consecutive quadratic
or quartic, etc., residues. The argument consists in forcing primes of the
form 3k + 1 to be residues and those of the form 3k + 2 to be nonresidues.
Similarly by making 2 a residue and as many odd primes as necessary
nonresidues, there is no such bound below which four consecutive k-th
power residues must appear for any k. This leaves open only the question
of three consecutive k-th powers for k odd. The case k = 3 was solved by
the Lehmers, Mills & Selfridge.

F7 A cubic analog of a Bhaskara equation.
Hugh Williams observes that if p == 3 mod 4, then the Bhaskara equation
x 2 - py2 = 2 has integer solutions just if the congruence w 2 == 2 mod p
does, i.e. just if (~) = 1, and asks for a cubic analog in the cases where
p t=- ±1 mod 9: x 3 + py3 + p2 z3 - 3pxyz = 3 is solvable just if w 3 == 3 mod p
is. Barrucand & Cohn have shown that this is true for p == 2 or 5 mod 9.
What about p == 4 or 7 mod 9? This is a special case of a more general
conjecture of Barrucand. If true, it would be useful in abbreviating the
calculations needed to find the fundamental unit (regulator) of the cubic
field Q ( .yp). There was a rumor that Harold Stark had settled this, but
he denies it, so the problem is still open.

F8 Quadratic residues whose differences are
quadratic residues.
Gary Ebert asks us to find the largest collection of quadratic residues
ri mod pn,    given pn == 1 mod 4, such that ri - rj is a quadratic residue
for all pairs (i,j). Fabrykowski shows that the maximum cardinality of
such a set is bounded above by pl/2 for all such primes, and bounded be-
low by (1 - to) In p / (2 In 2) for all sufficiently large primes. He later removed
the to for all primes p 2: 29 (and == 1 mod 4).

F9 Primitive roots
A primitive root, g, of a prime p is a number such that the residue classes
of g, g2, ... , gP-1 = 1 are all distinct. For example, 5 is a primitive root of
23 because
       5, 52 == 2, 53 == 10, 4, -3, 8, -6, -7, 11, 9, -1,
      -5,     -2,      -10, -4, 3, -8, 6, 7, -11, -9,   1
all belong to different residue classes mod 23.
    There is a famous conjecture of Artin, that for each integer 9 =1= -1, 9
not a square, there are infinitely many primes p with 9 as a primitive root.
Hooley proved this assuming the extended Riemann hypothesis, and Gupta
& Murty proved it unconditionally for infinitely many g. Heath-Brown
has proved the remarkable theorem that, but for at most two exceptional
primes PI, P2 the following is true: For each prime p there are infinitely
many primes q with p a primitive root of q. For example, there are infinitely
many primes q with either 2 or 3 or 5 as a primitive root.
    Erdos asks: if p is large enough, is there always a prime q < P so that
q is a primitive root of p?
    Given a prime p > 3, Brizolis asks if there is always a primitive root
9 of p and x (0 < x < p) such that x == gX mod p. If so, can 9 also be
chosen so that 0 < 9 < P and 9 1. (p - 1)? Zhang Wen-Peng answers this

             ... the Brizolis problem that you mention has now been
      solved by Mariana Campbell and myself. We show that for
      every prime p > 3 there is a primitive root 9 in the interval
      [l,p - 1] that is relatively prime to p - 1. A consequence is
      that there is a primitive root 9 and an integer x in the interval
      [I,p - 1] such that gX == x (mod p).
          We also plan to solve the Vegh problem you mention, [see
      next paragraph but one] in fact a stronger form of it: For ev-
      ery prime p > 61 and for every pair of nonzero residues a, b
      (mod p), there are primitive roots g, h such that ag + h = b
      (mod p). So, Vegh is the case a = -1. The case a = 1 is a
      conjecture of Golomb. The general case has been considered by
      Stephen Cohen.

    Pieter Moree notes that Brizolis was asking for a I-cycle of the discrete
logarithm, and that one can also ask for 2-cycles, i.e., pairs (g, h) such that
gh = a mod p and ga = h mod p with 0 < a < p. His work with Joshua
Holden is listed below.
    Vegh asks whether, for all primes p > 61, every integer can be expressed
as the difference of two primitive roots of p. W. Narkiewicz notes that
there is an affirmative answer for p > 1019 , so that this can, in theory, be
answered by computer.
    If p and q = 4p2 + 1 are both primes, Gloria Gagola asks if 3 is a
primitive root of q for all p > 3; is p = 193 the only odd prime for which 2
is not a primitive root of q; is p = 653 the only prime for which 5 is neither a
quadratic residue nor a primitive root of q; and is there a number, perhaps
a function of p (such as 2p -1 for large p), which is always a primitive root
of q? Jud McCranie verifies that 2 is a primitive root of q for all p < 2.5.108
except p = 193.
    The idea of primitive root can be extended to composite moduli by
letting a primitive root for a modulus n be an integer whose multiplica-
tive order modulo n is maximal. This maximal order is the Carmichael
function, >'(n). Clearly >'(n) ::; ¢(n), but for composite n can be dramat-
ically smaller. E.g., 3 and 7 are primitive roots of 10 in this sense, and
the primitive roots of 105 are ±{2,I7,23,32,37,38,47,52}, each of order
12. Note that the maximal order is not necessarily ¢(n). For properties of
such primitive roots and the difference in behavior of the analog of Artin's
conjecture, see the papers of Li & Pomerance.
    Golomb has conjectured that the finite field GF(q) of characteristic
q ~ 2 has two primitive roots, a, {3 (not necessarily distinct) with a+{3 = 1,
and if q ~ 3. with a + (3 = -1, and, for sufficiently large q, every nonzero
element of GF(q) can be represented as a + {3. Zhang has studied some
similar problems. See also papers of Chang, Cohen & Mullen, Gao, Le,
Moreno and Truong & Reed.

FlO Residues of powers of two.
Graham asked about the residue of 2n mod n. There are no solutions of
2n == 1 mod n with n > 1. 2n == 2 mod n whenever n is a pseudoprime
base 2 (see A12) or is a prime. In the early sixties the Lehmers found the
smallest solution, n = 4700063497 = 19·47·5263229, of 2n == 3 mod n.
Peter Montgomery found the second solution to be
  63130707451134435989380140059866138830623361447484274774099906755.
    Of course, n has to be composite, and it is not divisible by 2 or 3. In
fact, Ml}kowski (see reference at B5) notes that if       0)and      G)are of
opposite sign, i.e. if p = 24k ± 7 or ± 11, then n is not divisible by p.
    Rotkiewicz (compare A12) notes that if m satisfies 2m == 3 mod m,
then n = 2m - 1 is a solution of 2n - 2 == 1 mod n.
    Benkoski asked ifthere was a solution to 2n == 4 (mod n) which didn't
end in 7 when written in decimal notation. Zhang Ming-Zhi gave the
solutions where n == 1 or 3 (mod 1)0 and asked if there were any with
n == 9 (mod 1)0.
    Victor Meally reports that 2n == -1 (mod n) for n = 3k and 2n == -2
(mod n) for n = 2, 6, 66, 946, .... Schinzel notes that the existence of

except, of course, k = 1. Do solutions exist for all other k ?

Fll Distribution of residues of factorials.
What is the distribution of 1!, 2!, 3!, ... , (p-1)!, p! modulo p? About pie
of the residue classes are not represented. Here are the missing ones for
the first few values of p:

    p = 2 or 3, none.                  p = 5, {-2}.       p = 7, {-2, -3}.
    p=l1, {-2,±3,±4}.                  p=13, {-3,4,-5}.
    p = 17,   {4, 5, -6, -7, -8}.     p = 19, {3, -5, -6, ±7, ±8}.
    p = 23,   {-3, -4, -6, -7, -8, 1O}.
    p = 29, {-2, -4, 7, -8, -9, -10, -11, -12, 13, -14}.
    p = 31, {±3, 4, 8, ±1O, 11, 12, 13, 14}.
    p = 37,   {3, 4, ±5, -9, 10, 11, -14, ±15, -18}.

    Until we reach the last two entries we might be tempted to conjecture
that there were always at least as many negative entries as positive ones.
Are there infinitely many examples of each case? The value p = 23 is
remarkable in that the only duplicates are ±1.
    In answer to an Erdos question, Rokowska & Schinzel show that if the
residues of 2!, 3!, ... , (P-1)! are all distinct, then the missing residue must
be that of -9!, that p == 5 mod 8, and that there are no such p with
5 < p ~ 1000.

F12 How often are a number and its inverse
of opposite parity?
For each x (0 < x < p) where p is an odd prime, define x by xx == 1 mod p
and 0 < x < p. Let Np be the number of cases in which x and x are of
opposite parity. E.g., for p = 13, (x, x) = (1,1), (2,7), (3,9), (4,10), (5,8),

(6,11), (12,12) so N 13 = 6. D. H. Lehmer asks us to find Np or at least
to say something nontrivial about it. Np == 2 or 0 mod 4 according as
p== ±1 mod 4.

Yi & Zhang generalize to an odd integer q > 1 in place of p and k an integer
2': 1. If N(k, q) is the number of a mod q with (a, q) = 1 such that
                            q{ a;} and q{a;}
are of opposite parity, where {x} means the fractional part of x and a is
the inverse of a mod q, then they show that
                N(k, q) = ~<p(q) + Ok (q3/4d(q)1/2(log q)2),
    Chaladus has verified three conjectures of G. Terjanian, namely that if
Lp is the set of x having the same parity as X, then Lp are all residues just
if p = 5, 13 or 29; all residues are in Lp just if p = 3, 5, 7 or 13; and all
nonresidues are in Lp just if p = 3 or 7.
    Ruzsa & Schinzel have shown that the cardinalities of the four sets,
the intersections and the differences of Lp with the sets of residues and of
nonresidues are each ±p + O( y'p(ln p )2).
    Zhang Wen-Peng considers the case with q odd and not necessarily
prime in place of p. He shows that N q = ~<p(q) + O(ql/2+E) when q is a
prime power or the product of two primes.
    He also lets
                  L(p) = #{n : aa = np + 1, 1 ~ a ~ p - I}
    and asks what can be said about the asymptotic properties of L(p). In

F13 Covering systems of congruences.
A system of congruences ai mod ni (1 :::; i :::; k) is called a covering
system if every integer y satisfies y == ai mod ni for at least one value
of i. For example: 0 mod 2; 0 mod 3; 1 mod 4; 5 mod 6; 7 mod 12. If
c = nl < n2 < ... < nk then Erdos offers $500.00 for a proof or disproof
of the existence of covering systems with c arbitrarily large. Davenport &
Erdos, and Fried, found systems with c = 3; Swift with c = 6; Selfridge
with c = 8; Churchhouse with c = 10; Selfridge with c = 14; Krukenberg
with c = 18; and Choi with c = 20. c = 24 is reputed to have been ob-
tained by a Japanese. Erdos posthumously offers $1000.00 for a proof or
disproof that there are systems with arbitrarily large c. Simpson has also
reformulated open problems and offers cash prizes.
    Erdos offers $25.00 for a proof of the nonexistence of covering systems
with all moduli ni odd, distinct, and greater than one; while Selfridge offers
$900.00 for an explicit example of such a system. Berger, Felzenbaum &
Fraenkel showed that the I.c.m. of the moduli of such a system must contain
at least six prime factors. More generally, "odd" could be replaced by "not
divisible by the first r primes." Simpson & Zeilberger showed that if the
moduli are odd and squarefree then at least 18 primes are required.
    Jim Jordan offers comparable rewards to those mentioned above for
solutions to the analogous problems for Gaussian integers (A15).
    Erdos noted that you can have a covering system with all moduli ni
distinct, squarefree, and greater than one by using the proper divisors of
210:
               ai   0 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 2 23 4 5 59 104
               ni   2 3 5 6 7 10 14 15 21 30 35 42 70 105
384                                    Unsolved Problems in Number Theory


    Krukenberg used 2 and squarefree numbers greater than 3. Selfridge
asks if you can have such a system with c 2: 3 in place of c = 2. He observes
that the ni cannot all be squarefree with at most two prime factors, but
the above example shows that you do not need more than three.
    It is easy, but not trivial, to prove that, for a covering system with
distinct moduli, E~=ll/ni > 1. The sum can be arbitrarily close to 1 if
nl = 3 or 4. Sun Zhi-Wei showed that E~':-lll/ni 2: 1, where the omitted
nk is the largest of the distinct moduli. Selfridge & Erdos conjecture that
E l/ni > 1 + Cn l where Cn l ~ 00 with nl'
    Schinzel has asked for a covering system in which no modulus divides
another. This would not exist if a covering with odd muduli does not exist.
    Simpson calls a covering system irredundant if it ceases to cover the
integers when one of the congruences is removed. He has shown that if the
I.c.m. of the moduli of such a system is I1pr i then the system contains at
least 1 + E O!i (Pi - 1) congruences.
    Erdos conjectures that all sequences of the form d·2 k +l (k = 1, 2, ... ),
d fixed and odd, which contain no primes can be obtained from covering
congruences (see B21 for examples). Equivalently, the least prime factors
of members of such sequences are bounded.
    Sherman Stein asked if there exists an infinite set of congruences such
that every integer satisfies just one congruence, the moduli are distinct
with sum of reciprocals 1, and with at least one modulus not a power of 2.
Krukenberg found such a set with all moduli of the for 2i 3i . Ethan Lewis
showed that no other prime divisors of the moduli are possible, unless their
number is infinite.

F14 Exact covering systems.
If a system of congruences is both covering and disjoint (each integer cov-
ered by just one conguence) it is called an exact covering system. Neces-
sary, but not sufficient, conditions for a system to be exact are L:~=I l/ni =
1 and (ni' nj) > 1 for all i, j, where the notation is as in the first sentence
of F13. There is a theorem, variously attributed to subsets of {Davenport,
Mirsky, Newman, Rado} , that if a set of distinct numbers > 1 are the
moduli of congruences, then either there is a number which is not in any
of them or there is a number which is in more than one of them. The inge-
nious proof used a generating function and roots of unity. Combinatorial
proofs were later given by Berger, Felzenbaum & Fraenkel and by Simpson.

   Znam notes that (nI' n2, . .. ,nk) > 1 is not, as stated in the first edition,
a necessary condition, as is evinced by the example 0 (mod 6), 1 (mod 10),
2 (mod 15) and 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27,
28,29 (mod 30). He confirmed a conjecture of Mycielski by further proving
that if P is the least prime divisor of nk, then nk = nk-I = ... = nk-p+!.
He conjectured that if there exist only pairs of equal moduli, then the
moduli are all of the form 20<3/3, but later he and Burshtein & SchOnheim
and Joel Spencer each gave counter-examples, such as

            0, 1   2, 7   3, 8     13,28          4,9       14,34        19,39   59, 119
      mod    5      10     15       30             20        40           60       120

   Stein proved that if there is a single pair of equal moduli, the rest
being distinct, then ni = 2i (1 :::; i :::; k - 1), nk = 2k-I. Znam proved
analogously that if there is a triple of equal moduli, the rest being distinct,
then n;, = 2i (1 :::; i :::; k - 3), nk-2 = nk-I = nk = 3· 2 k - 3. Sun Zhi-Wei,
and independently Beebee, have extended Stein's result by showing that a
system is exact just if


                       . 7rZ = - 2k - I
                      SIn                   II. n·
                                             k
                                                  SIn -7r ( ai - Z ) •
                                            i=I         '

   Simpson extended work by Burshtein & SchOnheim and showed that if
the primes PI < P2 < ... < Pt are those dividing the moduli of an exact
covering system in which no modulus occurs more than N times, then


                                            II P--'-
                                            t-I
                                                  p.
                                 Pt:::; N
                                                 · -1
                                            i=I    '

   The main outstanding problem is to characterize exact covering con-
gruences.

    Porubsky asked if there is an "exactly m times covering system" which
is not the union of m exact covering systems. More generally, call such a
system 8 reducible if there is a partition 8 = 8 1 U 8 2 such that 8 1 and
8 2 are exactly l times and exactly m -l times covering systems for some l,
o < l < m, and irreducible if there is no such partition. Zhang Ming-Zhi
answers Porubskfs question affirmatively by showing that for every m > 1
there is an irreducible exactly m times covering system. This had already
been shown for m = 2 by S. L. G. Choi (Keszthely, 1973) and by Zeilberger,
e.g.:
   1(2); 0(3); 2(6); 0,4,6,8(10); 1,2,4,7,10,13(15); 5,11,12,22,23,29(30).
   Infinite disjoint covering systems with all moduli distinct can exist. If
the sum of the reciprocals of the moduli is 1, such systems exist with
moduli {2, 22 ,2 3 , •.• } and with sets of moduli of shape 2"'3.6. Fraenkel &
Simpson conjecture that these are the only types. Lewis showed that the
only possible exceptions had an infinite set of distinct primes dividing their
moduli.
   Questions can also be asked about covering systems of Beatty sequences
(E27). Graham showed that if Lmai + .Bd; m E Z; 1 :::; i :::; k is such a
system with k > 2 and at least one ai irrational, then some two ai must
be equal. This is not so if all the ai are rational, since


                                               (l:::;i:::;k)

are exactly covering systems. Fraenkel conjectures that the only such sys-
tems with distinct ai are of this form.
    There are connexions with pseudoperfect numbers (B2) and with Egyp-
tian fractions (D11). For a recent survey, with 139 references, see the paper
of Porubsky & Sch6nheim.

Szegedy won the prize that Graham offered for settling (affirmatively) the
question: does 0 < al < a2 < ... < an imply that maxi,j ai/(ai, aj) 2: n?
His proof, and that of Zaharescu, is for n sufficiently large. Cheng &
Pomerance have given the specific bound 104275 but there is still a fair
amount of ground to be covered.

FI6 Products of small prime powers
dividing n.
Erdos defines A(n, k) as I1 pa where the product is taken over primes p
less than k with palin and asks: is maxn minl::;i9 A(n+i, k) = o(k) ? He
remarks that it is easy to show that it is O(k). Is
                      minn maxl::;i::;k A( n + i, k) > kC

FI8 Size of the set of sums and products of
a set.
If aI, a2, ... , an are n numbers (not necessarily integers), how big is the
set of their sums and products in pairs?
                    i     l{ai+ aj}U{aiaj}l>n 2 - E        ?
    Erdos & Szemeredi have proved that the cardinality is greater than
n1+ c l and less than n2exp(-c2lnn/lnlnn). A+A can be small, e.g., if
A = {I, 2, ... , n}, and A· A can be small, e.g., if A = {I, 2, ... , 2n - I }, but
the conjecture is that they can't be simultaneously small.
    Erdos offers $100.00 for a proof or disproof that the cardinality is greater
than n 2- E and $250.00 for a more exact bound.
    Nathanson & Tenenbaum prove the conjecture in the special case where
the number of sums is very small. Nathanson has shown that
I(A + A) U (A· A)12     n*.

has cardinality at least chnh. See also her paper with Bourgain, and his
with Konyagin.

FI9 Partitions into distinct primes with
maximum product.
In the first edition we asked: if n is large and written in the form n = a+b+
c, 0 < a < b < c in every possible way, are all the products abc distinct, but
Leech observed that D16 answers this negatively. See also Kelly's paper.
Bernardo Recaman suggests that the opposite may be true, i.e., that any
sufficiently large n, when expressed as a sum n = a + b+ c in every possible
way, always yields two equal products abc. The analogous problem of
maximizing the I.c.m. in place of the product was studied algorithmically
by Drago.
    J. Riddell & H. Taylor asked if, among the partitions of n into distinct
primes, the one having the maximum product of parts is necessarily one
of those with the maximum number of parts, but Selfridge answered this
negatively with the example
319   =   2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 23 + 29 + 31 + 37 + 41 + 47 + 53
          3 + 5 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 + 31 + 37 + 41 + 43 + 47
but the partition with the smaller number of parts gives the largest possible
product. Is this the least counterexample? Jud McCranie confirmed that
it is:
  n                             terms                      log of product

F20 Continued fractions.
A number x may be expressed as a continued fraction




which, out of kindness to the typesetter, is often written




When the numerators bi are all 1 the continued fraction is called simple,
and may be written
                           x = [aD; al, a2, a3,"']
   It may be finite or infinite, but if x is rational it is finite. In this case
there are two possible forms, one of which has its last partial quotient,
ak, equal to 1:
                        176 =[0; 2, 3, 2] = [0; 2, 3,1,1]
    Zaremba conjectured that given any integer m > 1, there is an integer
a, 0 < a < m, a ..L m such that the simple continued fraction [0; al, ... ,ak]
for aim has ai    :sB for 1 i   :s :sk where B is a small absolute constant
                                              :s
(say B = 5). He was only able to prove ai C In m.

F21 All partial quotients one or two.
Not every number n can be expressed as the sum of two positive integers
n = a + b so that the continued fraction for alb has all its partial quotients
equal to 1 or 2. For 11, 17 and 19 we can have
       ~ = [0; 1, 1, 2, 1],   152 = [0; 2, 2, 2], and '(2 = [0; 1, 1, 2, 2]
    but 23 can't be so expressed. However Leo Moser conjectured that there
is a constant c such that every n can be so expressed with the sum of the
partial quotients, ~ ai < c In n.
    Bohuslav Divis asked for a proof that in any real quadratic field there
is always an irrational number whose simple continued fraction expansion
has all its partial quotients 1 or 2. He also asks the same question with 1
and 2 replaced by any pair of distinct positive integers.

F22 Algebraic numbers with unbounded
partial quotients.
Is there an algebraic number of degree greater than two whose simple con-
tinued fraction has unbounded partial quotients? Does every such num-
ber have unbounded partial quotients? Ulam asked particularly about the
number ~ = 1/(~ + y) where y = 1/(1 + y).
    Littlewood observed that if 0 has a continued fraction with bounded
partial quotients an, then liminf nl sin nOI ::; A(O), where A(O) is not zero
(though it is for almost all 0). He also asks if lim inf nl sin nO sin n¢1 = 0
for all real 0 and ¢ ? It is for almost all 0 and ¢. Cassels & Swinnerton-
Dyer treat a dual problem and show incidentally that 0 = 21 / 3 , ¢ = 41/ 3
does not provide a counterexample. Davenport suggested that a computer
might help with proving that l(xO - y)(x¢ - z)1 < € has solutions for every
0, ¢ when, for example, € = 1~ or    io.

so Victor Meally observed that the octave may conveniently be partitioned
into 12, 41 or 53 intervals, and that the system of temperament with 53
degrees is due to Nicolaus Mercator (1620-1687; not Gerhardus, 1512-1594,
of map projection fame).
    Ellison used the Gel'fond-Baker method to show that
                    \2 X - 3Y \ > 2x e- x / 10 for x > 27,
and Tijdeman used it to show that there is a c 2': 1 such that \2 X - 3Y \ >
2X /x c .
    Croft asks the corresponding question for n! - 2m . The first few best
approximations to n! by powers of 2 are
       5!      20!      22!            24!         61!        63!       90!

where the third row is the percentage error in the exponent.
     In the "Stellingen" that accompanied Benne de Weger's PhD thesis he
observed that if the primes PI, ... , Pt are given, then there is an effectively
computable constant C, depending only on the Pi, such that for all n, kb
... , k t with n! =1= p~l ... p~t it is true that
                     In! - p~l ... p~tl > exp(Cn/lnn).
    There is some experimental support for the conjecture that the right
side could be replaced by exp( C t n In n). For a fixed m, the methods of his
thesis will determine all solutions of n! - p~l ... p~t = m.
    Erdos believes the conjecture. He also observes that n! = 2a ± 2b only
when n = 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

F24 Some decimal digital problems.
Sin Hitotumatu asks for a proof or disproof that, apart from 102n , 4· 102n
and 9 . 102n , there are only finitely many squares with just two different
decimal digits, such as 38 2 = 1444, 882 = 7744, 1092 = 11881, 1732 =
29929, 2122 = 44944, 235 2 = 55225 and 31142 = 9696996.
   Pierre Barnouin, in a 96-08-30 letter, lists the only specimens with more
than 2 digits, in the following range:

 n 12 15 21 22 26 38 88 109 173 212 235 264 3114                     81619

    Another decimal digital problem was submitted to the MONTHLY by
Wu Wei Chao: prove that the sum of the decimal digits of 2n is less than
or equal to the sum of the decimal digits of 5n , with equality only if n = 3.
    The decimal representation of 2n contains no zero digit for n = 0, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 24, 25, 27, 28, 31, 32, 33, 34,
35, 36, 37, 39, 49, 51, 67, 72, 76, 77, 81 and 86. Shall we ever know if this
sequence is complete? Dan Hoey has checked that there are no others with
n ~ 2500000000.
    Bill Gosper asked about zeroless powers of n. Dean Hickerson observed
that if n == 2 (mod 3) and n > 2, then the cube of
N = ~(2 .105n _10 4n +17· 103n-l+102n+lOn_2) is zerofree. For example,
66666333339000033333666663 =
296291851949629281489792513816596763211148776994823592461481829631851896296
      If the digits of a number are monotonic, as in 24779, call it sorted.
John Guilford & John Hamilton have proved the equivalence of "b - 1 is
divisible by a square" and "there are infinitely many integers n such that
the base-b digits of both n and n 2 are sorted". So base 10 admits infinitely
many solutions. In fact Hamilton can find infinitely many n such that n,
n 2 , n 3 , ... , nm are all sorted in base b provided b-l is divisible by an m-th
power.

F25 The persistence of a number.
In the sequence 679, 378, 168, 48, 32, 6, each term is the product of the
decimal digits of the previous one. Neil Sloane defines the persistence of
a number as the number of steps (five in the example) before the number
collapses to a single digit. The smallest numbers with persistence 1, 2, ... ,
11 are 10, 25, 39, 77, 679, 6788, 68889, 2677889, 26888999, 3778888999,
F. None of the Above                                                        399

277777788888899. There is no number less than 1050 with persistence
greater than 11. Sloane conjectures that there is a number d such that
no number has persistence greater than d.
    In base 2 the maximum persistence is 1. In base 3 the second term is
zero or a power of 2. It is conjectured that all powers of 2 greater than 215
contain a zero when written in base 3. This is true up to 2500 . The truth
of this conjecture would imply that the maximum persistence in base 3 is
3.
    Sloane's general conjecture is that there is a number d(b) such that the
persistence in base b cannot exceed d(b).
    Erdos modifies the problem by letting f(n) be the product of the
nonzero decimal digits of n, and asks how fast one reaches a one-digit
number, and for which numbers is the descent slowest. He says that it easy
to prove that f(n) < n 1 - c , so that at most clnlnn steps are needed.

F26 Expressing numbers using just ones.
Let f (n) be the least number of ones that can be used to represent n using
ones and any number of + and x signs (and parentheses). For example,
         80 = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) x (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) x (1 + 1 + 1 + 1)
so f(80) :::; 13. It can be shown that f(3 k ) = 3k and 310g3 n :::; f(n) :::;
5log3 n where the logs are to base 3. Does f (n) '"" 3log3 n ?
    Daniel Rawsthorne has shown that f(n) = 2a + 3b when n is of the
form 2a 3b and not greater than 310. Is this true for larger such n ?
    Is it always true that for a prime p, f(p) = 1 + f(p - 1) ? And that
f(2p) = min{2 + f(p), 1 + f(2p - I)} ?
    Don Coppersmith notes that f(n) has an upper bound of 310g2 (n)
which is slightly less than 5Iog3 (n). The former comes from Horner's rule
on binary representation; the latter from Horner's rule on ternary repre-
sentation. Jeff Lagarias reports that a problem of Shub & Smale is to
let f w (m) be the minimum number of steps needed to generate musing
1, addition and multiplication, and fs(m) the minimum number using 1,
-1, addition, subtraction and multiplication, then Conjecture A is that
fs(n!) »k (In n)k for each k ~ 1 and Conjecture B is the same for fw(n!)
Conjecture A implies P:fNP in the Blum-Shub-Smale real number model
of computation.

F27 Mahler's generalization of Farey series.
The Farey series of order n consists of all positive rational numbers in
their lowest terms, with numerators and denominators not exceeding n,
arranged in order of magnitude. For example, the Farey series of order 5 is
  1      1   1   ~   1   ~   ~    ~   i   1    Q   i   ~   Q   ~   Q   ~   i   5

   The determinant formed from the numerators and denominators of two
adjacent fractions is -1. Mahler regards the members of the sequence as
positive real roots of linear equations whose coefficients have g.c.d. 1 and
do not exceed n, and obtained the following apparent generalization to
quadratic equations.

    which have positive real roots, in order of size of the roots. Then the
third-order determinant (see F28) formed from any three consecutive rows
of a, b, c appeared always to take the value 0 or ±1. In the first edition,
Table 10 illustrated this for n = 2, with initial and final entries (0,1,0)
and (0,0,1), corresponding to roots 0 and 00, just as the Farey series could
include the terms ¥ and      !.  We also adopted a suggestion of Selfridge of
duplicating rational roots to avoid trivial exceptions. The present Table
10 is an excerpt from the generalized series for n = 3. The entry in the
last column is the value of the determinant formed from that row and its
immediate neighbors.

  The conjecture was verified for n :::; 5, but Lambertus Hesterman of
Canberra discovered counterexamples when n = 7; for example

                a     b     c         root                 determinant
                2   -7     -7    (7 + V105)/4
                1   -3     -6     (3 + J33)/2                   -2
                1   -6      7        3 + v'2
   Can this be rescued, or is it yet another example of the Strong Law of
Small Numbers? Lewis Low proved that the absolute value of the deter-
minant cannot exceed n. Can this bound be substantially reduced?
   What can be said about the fourth-order determinants associated with
cubic equations?

the determinants to 3. A topological significance was given, with references

Given a prime p, find pairs of functions f(x), g(x) such that one of the
congruences f(x) == n, g(x) == n mod p is solvable for all integers n. A
trivial example is f(x) = x 2 , g(x) = ax 2 where a is a quadratic nonresidue
(F5) of the odd prime p. Mordell gives the further example f(x) = 2x+dx4 ,
g( x) = x-I /4dx 2 , where d is any integer prime to p and 1/ z is defined as
z, where zz == 1 mod p.

It was noted in Dl that no nontrivial solution of a 5 +b5 = c5 +d5 is known.
In fact x 5 is a likely answer to the following unsolved problem of Erdos.
Find a polynomial P(x) such that all the sums P(a) + P(b) (0::; a < b) are
distinct. Rusza has proved that there is a real number ~ such that the set
                           {Ln 5 +~n4J} : n> no
is a Sidon set (see C9) for a suitable constant no. In fact he proves a more
general theorem in which the exponents 5 and 4 are respectively replaced
by a and (3 where a > 4 and (3 > 3 + 1/(a - 1).

F31 Miscellaneous digital problems.
Express the integers in base 4, using the digits 0, 1, 2 and I (= -1). Let
L be the set of integers which can be written in this way using the digits
0, 1 and I, but not 2. Can every odd integer be written as the quotient of
two elements of L? Loxton & van der Poorten show that, given an odd k,
there is indeed a multiplier m such that m and km are both in L, but their
analysis is ineffective in the sense that they do not know how to estimate
the smallest such m. It may be that there is an absolute constant C such
that there is always a multiplier less than IkI G . Examples requiring large
multipliers are k = 133 = 2011 4, m = 333 = 111114 and k = 501 = 20111 4,
m = 2739 = 1IIII11 4.
    John Selfridge & Carole Lacampagne ask if every k == ±1 mod 3 can
be written as the quotient of integers which can be represented in base
3 using the digits 1 and I, but not O. Experiments suggested that the
answer is yes, but Don Coppersmith answers negatively with the example
k = 247 = 1000113. He claims that there is no m such that both m and
km are expressible in base 3 using digits +1 and -1 but not O. If we allow
the digits 0 and 1, but not 2, then which integers can be written as such a
quotient?

= 7436, 7436 + 6347 = 13783, 13783 + 38731 = 52514, 94039, 187088,
1067869,10755470,18211171, ... ?
    Conway's 'RATS' is 'Reverse, Add, Then Sort'. E.g., 16+61=77,
77+77=154, sort into 145, 145+541=686, sort into 668, 668+866=1534,
1345+5431=6776, 6677+7766=14443, and after ten more terms we have
the divergent, period-two, patterns, 1334434432, 5677667765, 13344334432,
56776667765, ... , in which the numbers of threes and of sixes in the mid-
dles of alternate terms steadily increase. Conway's conjecture is that any
initial number leads either to this pattern, or to a cycle, such as one of:

       Initial number    3     29    69   3999       6999       27888
       Cycle length      8     18     2     2         14          2
       Least member     11    1223   78   11127    11144445     11667

    Many other cycles have been discovered by Curt McMullen and by
Cooper & Kennedy. Shattuck & Cooper found divergent RATS sequences
in bases 50, 99, 148, 962, 18n + 1, 18n + 10 and (2t - 1)2 + 1, where t is
a prime or pseudoprime, base 2. Conway's conjecture, that in base 10, all
RATS sequences either cycle or are tributary to the sequence
            123m 44, 52 6m 74 , 12 3m +1 44, 52 6m +1 74 , ..• ,
    (where superscripts denote numbers ofrepetitions of the digit) remains
an open question.
